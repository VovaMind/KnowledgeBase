# System thinking

## Systems

*  System is more than the sum of its parts.
*  Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information.
*  The least obvious part if the system, its function or puroise, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behaviour.
*  System structure is the source of system behaviour, which reveals itsels as a series of events over time.

## Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium

*  A stock is the memory of the history if changing flows within the system.
*  Inflows > outflows -> stock level will rise.
*  Inflows < outflows -> stock level will fall.
*  Inflows = outflows -> dynamic equilibrium.
*  Stock can be increased by both decreasing outflow, and increasing inflow.
*  Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
*  Stokcs allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and indepedent.

## Feedback loops

*  Feedback is a closed chain of casual connectionss from a stock, through decisions/rules/laws/actions, and back again though a flow to change the stock.
*  Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating in systems. Both source of stability and resistance to change.
*  Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth, or to runaway collapses over time.
*  Information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect the future, it can't be fast enough to correct behaviour that drove the current feedback.
*  Stock maintaining feedback loop must compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect the stock.
*  Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviours.

## Shifting dominance, delays, and oscillations
