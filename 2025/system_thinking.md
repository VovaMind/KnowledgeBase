# System thinking

## Systems

*  System is more than the sum of its parts.
*  Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information.
*  The least obvious part if the system, its function or puroise, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behaviour.
*  System structure is the source of system behaviour, which reveals itsels as a series of events over time.

## Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium

*  A stock is the memory of the history if changing flows within the system.
*  Inflows > outflows -> stock level will rise.
*  Inflows < outflows -> stock level will fall.
*  Inflows = outflows -> dynamic equilibrium.
*  Stock can be increased by both decreasing outflow, and increasing inflow.
*  Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
*  Stokcs allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and indepedent.

## Feedback loops

*  Feedback is a closed chain of casual connectionss from a stock, through decisions/rules/laws/actions, and back again though a flow to change the stock.
*  Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating in systems. Both source of stability and resistance to change.
*  Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth, or to runaway collapses over time.
*  Information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect the future, it can't be fast enough to correct behaviour that drove the current feedback.
*  Stock maintaining feedback loop must compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect the stock.
*  Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviours.

## Shifting dominance, delays, and oscillations

*  Complex behaviours often arise as the relative strength of feedback loops shift, causing shifting in dominating.
*  A delay in a balancing feedback loop liekely makes a system to oscillate.
*  Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the behaviour of a system.

## Scenarios and testing models

*  System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask "what if" questions.
*  Model utility depens not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic (we can't be sure anyway), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behaviour.

## Contraints on systems

*  In physial envrinoment one needs at least one reinforcing feedback loop, and at least one balancing loop which constrains growth. One can't grow forever in a finite environment.
*  Non-renewable resources are stock-limited.
*  Renewable resources are flow-limited.

## Resilience, self-organization, and hierarchy

*  Resilience has its limits.
*  Systems need to be managed not only for productivity/stability, but for also for resilience.
*  Self-organizational property. It's ability to stucture themselves: create new structures, to learn/deversify anf complexify.
*  Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper levels is to serve purposes of the lower layers.

## Source of system surprises

*  Many relationships in systems are nonlinear.
*  There are no separate systems, the world is a continuum. Boundaries around a system depend on the purpose of the discussion.
*  At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting.
*  Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by layers of limits.
*  There always will be limits to growth.
*  A quantity growing exponentially toward a limit reaches that limit in a surprinsingly short time.
*  When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight is essential.
*  The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole.

## Mindsets and models

*  Everything we think we know about the world is a model.
*  Our models do have a strong congruence witht the world.
*  Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully.

## System traps

### Policy resitance

*  Various goals for different actors.
*  A policy might pull the system away from the goals of some actors.
*  Producing additional resistance.
*  Nobody likes the result, everyone spends considerable efforts: enforcing, resisting.

Ways out are:

*  Let go.
*  Bring actors together, find mutually satisfactory ways for realizing all of the goals.
*  Redefine larger/more important goals, so everyone can pull towards together.

### Tragedy of commons

*  Commonly shared resource.
*  Everyone benefirts directly for its usage.
*  Sharing costs and abuse with everyone else.
*  Weak feedback: resource condition -> decisions of the users.
*  Overuse of the resource, eroding it until it becomes unavailable to everyone.

Ways out are:

*  Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences.
*  Restore or strengthen the missing feedback link: privatizing the resource -> each user feels direct consequences of its abuse; regulating the access for all users to the resource.

### Drift to low performance

*  Allowing performance standards to be influences by past performances.
*  Especially bad if there is a negative bias in perceiving past performance.
*  Sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals thats sets a system drifting towards low performance.

Ways out are:

*  Keep performance standards absolute.
*  Let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst.
*  Set a drift towards high performance.

### Escalation

*  When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock and the other way around.
*  Reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race / wealth race etc.
*  The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes very fast.
*  With intervetion this spiral would continue till somone's collapse - exponential growth can go on forever.

Ways out are:

*  It's better to avoid it.
*  One can refuse to continue (unileterally disarm).
*  One can negotiate a new system with balancing loops to control the escalation.

### Success to successful

*  Winners got systematically rewarded with means to win again.
*  Reinforcing feedback loop, winners eventually take it all, while losers are eliminated.

Ways out are:

*  Diversification - allows starting new games.
*  Strict limitation on fraction of the pie for a single winner (antitrust lawys).
*  Policies that level the playing field, removing advantages of the strongest or increasing the advantage of th weakest.
*  Policies that devise rewards for success that don't bias the next round.

### Shifting the burden to the intervenor

*  Systemic problem.
*  Addressing symptoms / or even disguise them.
*  Not solving the actual problem.
*  Policy that hides the underlying trouble / drug of choice.
*  Eroding self-maintaining capacity.
*  More and more of the actual solution is required.
*  System will rely more and more on interventions, and less and less able to maintain its own desired state.

Ways out are:

*  It's better to avoid it.
*  Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying policies that don't address the problem.
*  Focus not on the short-term relief, but on long-term restructuring.
*  Intervenor - restore/enhane self maintaining, then remove yourself.

### Rule beating

*  Perverse behaviour which gives appearance of following the rules / achieving the goals, but it actuall distorts the system.

Way out: Design/redesign rules for moving creativity towards actual goals and not towards beating the rules.

### Seeking the wrong goal

*  System behaviour is very sensitive to goals of feedback loops.
*  If goals are ill-defined, then system might produce a result that is not really intended or wanted.

  Ways out are: 
  
  *  Specify indicators and goals which reflect the real state of the system.
  *  Not confuse effort with result, otherwise you might end up with a system which produces efforts not results.

## Places to intervene in a system (increaing order of effectiveness)

*  Numbers / parameters.
*  Buffers - size of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows.
*  Stock-and-Flow structures. Physical systems and their nodes of intersection.
*  Delays. Time relative to the rates of system changes.
*  Balancing feedback loops. Strength of feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct.
*  Reinforcing feedback loops. Strenth of the gain of driving loops.
*  Information flows. Who (and when) has access to information.
*  Rules. Incebtives, punishments, constraints.
*  Self-organization. Power to add/change/evolve system structure.
*  Goals. The purpose of the system,
*  Paradigms. Them ind-set out of which the system, its goals/structure/rules/delays/parameters - arises.
*  Transcending paradigms.

## Guidelines

*  Get the beat of the system.
*  Expose your mental modesl to the light of day.
*  Honor/respect/distribute infromation.
*  Use language with care and enrich it with system concepts.
*  Pay attention to what is important, no just what is quantifiable.
*  Make feedback policies for feedback systems.
*  Go for the good of the whole.
*  Listen to the wisdom of the system.
*  Locate responsibility within the system.
*  Stay humble/a learner.
*  Celebrate complexity.
*  Expand the time horizons.
*  Defy the disciplines.
*  Expand the boundary of caring.
*  Don't erode the goal of goodness.
