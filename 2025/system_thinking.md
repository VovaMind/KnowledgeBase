# System thinking

## Systems

*  System is more than the sum of its parts.
*  Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information.
*  The least obvious part if the system, its function or puroise, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behaviour.
*  System structure is the source of system behaviour, which reveals itsels as a series of events over time.

## Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium

*  A stock is the memory of the history if changing flows within the system.
*  Inflows > outflows -> stock level will rise.
*  Inflows < outflows -> stock level will fall.
*  Inflows = outflows -> dynamic equilibrium.
*  Stock can be increased by both decreasing outflow, and increasing inflow.
*  Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
*  Stokcs allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and indepedent.

## Feedback loops

*  Feedback is a closed chain of casual connectionss from a stock, through decisions/rules/laws/actions, and back again though a flow to change the stock.
*  Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating in systems. Both source of stability and resistance to change.
*  Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth, or to runaway collapses over time.
*  Information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect the future, it can't be fast enough to correct behaviour that drove the current feedback.
*  Stock maintaining feedback loop must compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect the stock.
*  Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviours.

## Shifting dominance, delays, and oscillations

*  Complex behaviours often arise as the relative strength of feedback loops shift, causing shifting in dominating.
*  A delay in a balancing feedback loop liekely makes a system to oscillate.
*  Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the behaviour of a system.

## Scenarios and testing models

*  System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask "what if" questions.
*  Model utility depens not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic (we can't be sure anyway), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behaviour.

## Contraints on systems

*  In physial envrinoment one needs at least one reinforcing feedback loop, and at least one balancing loop which constrains growth. One can't grow forever in a finite environment.
*  Non-renewable resources are stock-limited.
*  Renewable resources are flow-limited.

## Resilience, self-organization, and hierarchy
