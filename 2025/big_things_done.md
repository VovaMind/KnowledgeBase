# How big things get done

## Intro

Power / psycology aspects.

Failures / successes at big projects.

## Think slow, act fast

Failures happen a lot. 

Data collection on big projects.

Over budget, over time all the time

People have tendency to being overly optimistic about timeline, benefits, and costs.

Not normal distribution - heavy tail distribution aka terrible overruns in time/budget. Risks of things going disasterously wrong.

Black swan problems.

Project drag on - failure tendency. Success is often quick.

Longer runtime - higher chance of black swans or so.

Vision and planning.

Planning is safe harbor. Planning is relatively cheap in comparison to execution. Cost of planning iteration is fairly low.

Projects don't go wrong, they start wrong.

## Commitment fallacy

Pentagon building story - unrealistic/wrong commitment initially.

Rush to commit.

Strategic misrepresentation: way to win a contract.

You want the flight attendant, not the pilot to be an optimist

Snap judgement / subconcious decision making. 

Optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly.

Pricinple: What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI) - assumption that whatever information we have on hand is all the info available to make decision.

After quick and intuitive judgement it's time to slow/careful thinking from conscious mind.

Emotions / logic in decision making.

Something might "feel" true.

Practical decision making - based on feeling or so.

Hofstadter's law: people underestimate time required to complete tasks, even with avaialable information about estimations being unreasonable.

Ignoring previous experience / this time is different.

Typical estimation goes for best case scenario. But it's not particularly likely.

Bias against thinking.

Bias to action vs bias against thinking.

Planning is working. Progress on planning is progress on project, often the most cost-effective.

Strategic misrepresenatation - political tool.

Start digging a hole - figure it out later. Time drags on, costs exploded.

Driving into blizzard.

Commit to not commit. Feel urge to commit - at first commit to having an open mind.

## Thinking from right to left

Don't start with solutions, start with asking questions and considering alternatives. Always assume that there is more to learn. Start with question why?

Story about big renovation project when price escalated.

Slow planning isn't good because it's slow. Good planning explores, anlyzers, tests, and iterates. This takes time.

Range and depth of questions + rigor in answers -> good planning. Always start with questions, not answers.

Why are we doing this project?

Start with customer experience, and work backwards to the technology.

Amazon approach: press release + FAQ as a part of project planning. 1h for pitching projects, asking hard questions.

Problem: right to left thinking isn't natural. 

Always keep the goal in view.

## Pixar planning

People are terrible at getting things right the first time, but we are great at tinkering. 

Try, learn, repeat.

Planning often sounds abstract and bureaucratic. Experiri (to try / to test / to prove): different between good and bad planning.

Successfully found many ways that don't work.

Experimentation requires simulation.

Many iterations, serious testing/simulations - reliable plan.

Architecture and innovative software for prototyping.

Pixar and many planning iterations: cheap early on, getting more expensive over iterations once details are emerging.

Don't be afraid to through aways ideas.

One needs the freedom to just try, and it won't work many times.

Attention to details.

Illusion of explanatory depth: people feel that they understand things way more than they actually do.

Planning is fairly cheap.

Planning is an active process.

MVP concept.

Maximum virtual product.

## Are you experiences?

Experience is invaluable, but it's often overlooked / misunderstood.

Big projects often don't make max use of experience.

Phronesis - practical wisdom.

Marginalizing experience - anti-pattern.

Being first ambition. First-mover advantage is overstated.

Early on the market != being a pioneer.

Terrible cost of being first - can't learn from previous mistakes.

Ambitions being biggest, tallest, longest, fastest.

Frozen experience - proven technologies.

Olympic bad examples.

We know more than we can tell. Explicit knowledge vs intuition.

Project leader with phronesis is the signle greatest assest a project can have.

## So you think your project is unique?

Why there is a big gap between expectations and reality of project work? Writinge example: historical books usually take years to write, the expectations were unrealistic.

Anchoring and adhjustment. Particular experience works like an anchor, then applying it everywhere - adjustment.

Anchoring is very typical for estimations from psycological POV. Picking bad anchor - bad estimation.

Correct anchoring is crucial.

Finding similar projects - sounds too simply, but it works in practice.

Reference-class forecasting (RCF).

RCF problemas are: Some folks deliverately low-balling. Uniqueness bias. Not enough data.

Finding good data is tricky.

Fat tail distributions. What to do with it? Cut the fat tail.

Black swan management:

*  Think slow, act fast.
*  They can be studied and mitigated.
*  Dig the data from the reference claass.
*  Matter of probability not certainty.
*  Move probabilities in our favor, but you never get certainty.

## Can ignorance be your friend?

Planning just ruins you process/creativity. Just trust the process / rely on shiny past examples. These are terrible ideas, and it's not how it works.

Cool examples in the past. Inspiring stories.

It doesn't match the actual reality/statistics.

Stories vs data. Survival bias. Relevant success stories are visible, but actually rare / more of a dumb luck.

Actual success doesn't come from ignorance.
