# How big things get done

## Intro

Power / psycology aspects.

Failures / successes at big projects.

## Think slow, act fast

Failures happen a lot. 

Data collection on big projects.

Over budget, over time all the time

People have tendency to being overly optimistic about timeline, benefits, and costs.

Not normal distribution - heavy tail distribution aka terrible overruns in time/budget. Risks of things going disasterously wrong.

Black swan problems.

Project drag on - failure tendency. Success is often quick.

Longer runtime - higher chance of black swans or so.

Vision and planning.

Planning is safe harbor. Planning is relatively cheap in comparison to execution. Cost of planning iteration is fairly low.

Projects don't go wrong, they start wrong.

## Commitment fallacy
