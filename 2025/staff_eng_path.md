# Staff Engineer Path

## Intro

Career paths: management, engineering/tech/domain expert. Technical IC track.

Pillars of staff engineering:

*  Big-picture thinking: strategy, vision etc.
*  Execution: driving and unblocking big efforts.
*  Leveling up: role model, mentoring, teaching etc.

## Why does this role exist?

Engineers who see a big picture, project execution, leveling up.

Context for good decisions. Local maximum for a team/group vs optimal decision for all company/org.

Outsider view: considering goals of multiple teams, choosing the best way for the whole org/business.

CTO on a lover/local level.

Ownership for the whole thing, not any of its individual parts.

Technical excellence/good choinces vs job gets done on time (TPM).

Technical influence.

Not a manager, but a leader.

Technical role.

Aim to be autonomous.

Setting a technical direction.

Communicate well and often.

Reporting chain: high vs low trade-off. Too much details vs not to interesting for a higher level leadership.

Scope choosing.

Too broad scope problems are:

*  Lack of impact.
*  Becomming a bottleneck
*  Decision fatigue.
*  Missing relationships.

Too narrow scope problems are:

*  Lack of impact.
*  Opportunity cost.
*  Overshadowing other engs.
*  Overengineering.

Shape of the role:

*  Depth-first vs breadth-first mentality.
*  Four disciplines: core tech skills, product management, project management, people management.
*  Coding: how much?
*  Delayed gratification.
*  Archetypes: TLs, architects, solvers, right hands.

Caring about things.

What's important? Your work needs to be important.

What needs you?

Plan for my work over the next year: scope, shape, primary focus.

Your job is to make your org successful.

Staff eng role is ambiguos by definition. It's up to you to discover and decide what your role is etc.

Time is finite, be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that's important and that isn't wasting your skills.

Align with your management chain.

Things can go weird and that's ok.

Broad view.

Locator map: where you are.

Topological map: learning the terrain.

Treasure map.

Removing fog of war :)

Getting perspective, too much focus brings the following risks:

*  Prioritizing badly.
*  Losing empathy.
*  Tuning out background noise.
*  Forgetting what the work is for.

Seeing bigger. Some ideas are:

*  Taking an outsider view. Note: **respect what came before**.
*  Escaping the echo chamber.
*  What's actually important?
*  What do your customers care about?
*  Have your problems been solved before?
