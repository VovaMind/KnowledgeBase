# Staff Engineer Path

## Intro

Career paths: management, engineering/tech/domain expert. Technical IC track.

Pillars of staff engineering:

*  Big-picture thinking: strategy, vision etc.
*  Execution: driving and unblocking big efforts.
*  Leveling up: role model, mentoring, teaching etc.

## Why does this role exist?

Engineers who see a big picture, project execution, leveling up.

Context for good decisions. Local maximum for a team/group vs optimal decision for all company/org.

Outsider view: considering goals of multiple teams, choosing the best way for the whole org/business.

CTO on a lover/local level.

Ownership for the whole thing, not any of its individual parts.

Technical excellence/good choinces vs job gets done on time (TPM).

Technical influence.

Not a manager, but a leader.

Technical role.

Aim to be autonomous.

Setting a technical direction.

Communicate well and often.

Reporting chain: high vs low trade-off. Too much details vs not to interesting for a higher level leadership.

Scope choosing.

Too broad scope problems are:

*  Lack of impact.
*  Becomming a bottleneck
*  Decision fatigue.
*  Missing relationships.

Too narrow scope problems are:

*  Lack of impact.
*  Opportunity cost.
*  Overshadowing other engs.
*  Overengineering.

Shape of the role:

*  Depth-first vs breadth-first mentality.
*  Four disciplines: core tech skills, product management, project management, people management.
*  Coding: how much?
*  Delayed gratification.
*  Archetypes: TLs, architects, solvers, right hands.

Caring about things.

What's important? Your work needs to be important.

What needs you?

Plan for my work over the next year: scope, shape, primary focus.

Your job is to make your org successful.

Staff eng role is ambiguos by definition. It's up to you to discover and decide what your role is etc.

Time is finite, be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that's important and that isn't wasting your skills.

Align with your management chain.

Things can go weird and that's ok.

## Theree maps

Broad view.

Locator map: where you are.

Topological map: learning the terrain.

Treasure map.

Removing fog of war :)

Getting perspective, too much focus brings the following risks:

*  Prioritizing badly.
*  Losing empathy.
*  Tuning out background noise.
*  Forgetting what the work is for.

Seeing bigger. Some ideas are:

*  Taking an outsider view. Note: **respect what came before**.
*  Escaping the echo chamber.
*  What's actually important?
*  What do your customers care about?
*  Have your problems been solved before?

Locator map gives perspective, but you can't navigate it. Topological map helps with it.

Potential difficulties which could be resolved using a topological map:

*  Your good ideas don't get traction.
*  You don't find outa bout the difficult parts until you get there.
*  Everything takes longer.

Understanding the org:

*  Culture: autonomy, inclusion, safety, decision making, making progress, personal communication.
*  Secret/open.
*  Oral/written.
*  Top-down vs bottom-up.
*  Fast change / deliberate change.
*  Back channels / front doors.
*  Allocated / available.
*  Liquid / crystallized.
*  Power / rules / mission. Information flows.
*  Points of interest.
*  Chasms between teams and orgs.
*  Fortresses.
*  Disputed territory.
*  Uncrossable deserts.
*  Paved roads / shortcuts / long ways around.

Useful aspects for topological maps are:

*  How decisions are made?
*  Where is "the room"?
*  Asking to join in.
*  Shadow org chart. Unwritten structures.

It's important to keep the map up to date:

*  New leads.
*  Project deprioritization.
*  Quarterly planning.
*  New platform.
*  Extended leave, e.g. PM.

Be a bridge, if the terrain is difficult to navigate.

Treasure map: where are we going?

Shiny / short-term things: good to an extend, but it's hard without a big plan:

*  Hard to keep everyone going in the same direction.
*  Not finishing big things.
*  Cruft accumulation.
*  Competing initiatives.
*  Engs stop growing.

Taking longer view:

*  Why are you doing what you are doing?
*  Sharing the map.

Unclear map -> draw a new one.

Remember about your personal journey.

Practice looking for a bigger picture and seeing what's happening.

Understand your work in context.

Know your org.

Build/discover paths to access needed information.

Be clear about goals for everyone.

## Creating the big picture

Example with many teams/priorities/plans/ideas -> need to navigate. Actionable/realistic plan, prioritizing instead of solving everything at once, not trying to make everyone happy.

Technical vision - future which you want to achieve. Describing everything after the work is done.

Vision creates a shared reality.

Vision can be on different levels: engineering, org, group/team.

Vision doesn't make all decisions, but it should remove sources of conflict/ambiguity.

Vision should empower everyone to choose their own path while being confident that they will end up at the right place.

Parts of the vision might be:

*  High-level values and goals.
*  Set of principles to use for making decisions.
*  Summary of decisions that have already been made.
*  Architecural diagram.
