# Happiness coursera course

## Week 1

Self-reporting about happiness is quite representative. It correlates with other objective metrics.

Concept of happiness is a balloon. If we make mistakes (happiness sins) then the balloon have holes and happiness getting smaller. 
If we inflate the balloon by the good habbits, then we make balloon bigger.

Happiness metric: https://isb.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_23TdZGYzQsfMeYB?user_id=12620598 (35 - max, I got 18).

There are 7 happiness sins.

The first sin is devaluing happiness.

Happiness was rated the highest amoung 12 possible goals (including success, money etc). 
But if you will ask for 3 wishes it normally about money, relationship, fame etc and only 6% ask for happiness.

We can prefer smth which is worse for us, but it costs more, like prefer vegetables over chicken in a salad bar, 
if price is fixed for weight. We can try to prefer being right or prove smth in relations. We sacrifice happiness for other goals.
And those goals aren't that important.

Job-choice. The same idea here. We select smth with more stress/money and less interesting. 
So we devalue happiness there for the material goals.

There are 3 misconceptions about happiness: it makes us lazy, selfish and it won't last for a long time. All of them totally wrond.
Instead we can be more creative and motivated, donate more and we can define happiness in a correct way. It's negative beliefs.

It's can be hard to define happiness concretly and it makes it harder to prioritize.

Medium maximization concept. It's when we focused not on a final goal, but on a medium one. For example, money. 
They don't have value itself, but people have tendency to focus on them.

The idea to overcame davaluing happiness is prioritize but don't pursue happiness.
So we should remind ourselves to prioritize happiness.
But we shouldn't constanly check our happiness level or overthink about it.

My defenition of happiness: feel well physically and mentally, learn new stuff, have a good relations with my family and other people.

Things which make me happy (4 examples):

*  Doing excercies, like tennis, swimming, maybe yoga etc.
*  Learn/deep-dive into new stuff. Cources, books, working on smth etc.
*  Having good "fun" - ???
*  Positive communication with my family and with other people.

## Week 2

Chasing superiority.

Why do we chasing superiority:

*  It feels good to be admired by others.
*  We feel good when we win
*  It feels that we progressing towards mastery.
*  We have a greater sense of autonomy.

Chasing superiority lowers happiness, because of:

*  Social comparisons. In order to measure your skill you will compare yourself with others. And everytime you will find someone better. So, in fact, this approach will separate you from the other people.
*  Materialism. Matiralistic thing won't make you happy for a long time.
*  Being disliked by others.

Story about the motivation. High rewards won't help to perform better in non-mechanical tasks. Chasing superiority will distract you and wil take resources from the important tasks. However, it can motivate you, but it's a bad approach to motivation. So, it makes performance better.

Concept of the flow. It can belong to all domains and all people can achive it. Characteristics of flow:

*  Distorted perception of time.
*  Lack of self-consiousness.
*  Intense focus on the present moment.

For flow it's better to have some experience and understanding and have some challange for you, like a bit stronger tennis opponent.

Flow makes your happy, because of:

*  It feels good at the moment.
*  It makes you likeable. Story about resources. Flow is infinite resource, not like money etc. So people intuitively feel that you not an enemy, which want to "steal" resources from them. 

Flow makes your happy and leads you towards the success. 10.000 hours with flow can build mastery/expertise in a topic.

It also connected to your's understanding of the work importance. For smth useless (in your opinion) you won't have flow state.

Also work should be enjoyable and challenging at the right level. Without it we won't feel regular flow.

How to find flow:

*  Identify your talents and nurture them.
*  Identify what your community needs.

Intersection of: what you are good at, what the world needs, what you enjoy doing? Try different ares and hobbys. Remember the idea of enjoyable and challenging on a right level.

Try be a volunteer for smth.

Self-compassion. When you feel bad or smth went wrong speak/treat to youself as to a good friend. People are often too self-critical. 

Why self-compassion helps with chasing superiority:

*  Helps to migrate the need for superiority.
*  Helps us recognize that failures and set-backs are part of life.

Gratitude. It smth went really well be gratitude to the other. It helps with social connections and it will make you happier. It also helps against chasing superiority. Gratitude helps a lot from many aspects.

## Week 3

Being too needy or too avoidant.

Need to be loved is very deep and important part of the human nature. It can stronger than need in food. Sense of belongingness is very important.

Experiment with show and another guy. Disliking together is stronger than liking by yourself (social nature). Feeling connection on agreement. Socialozong is very enjoyable activity.

Being needy is bad, because:

*  It makes us less attractive.
*  It makes us less respected by others.
*  It involves us to a wrong kind of relationships.
*  It makes you lose respect for yourself.

Avoidance is bad, because:

*  It goes against our nature.
*  It gives you less cooperation from others: both colleagues and other peoppl.
*  It makes you dissatisfied at work.

Secury attachment is a state between neediness and avoidance. It's important to stay there. I have tendency to being needy.

Self-compassion and gratitude can be helpful.

Experiment with spending money on youself or on the others. Spending on the others boosts happiness.

It's important to love and give. There are scientific evidence for it.

Being self-centered and greedy is bad for happiness level, but being selflessness is also bad (giving too much/everything). 

You should be "smart" (otherish giver):

*  Contain cost of giving. (Am I right person?, Help multiple people at once).
*  Exercise value-enhancing strategies. Allow themselves to feel gratitude, pride etc, Say "no" at times.
*  See impact of your generocity. (see yourself capable and compitent).
*  Have fun.

Being kind and generous is important! Reasons: makes you feel connected with others, it's in our nature, feel compitent and capable, evokes love/compassion, which feels good.

Other reasons for being kind and generous: makes you feel more secure in relationships, enhancing your chances of success in your career, triggering an inner transformation.

Rules of giving:

*  Include yourself in your generocity.
*  See the impact of your generosity on others.
*  Habe fun in the act of giving.

Freedom and independence are important goals, food control can be iterpreted as a lack of freedom.

I got 23 from 35 from the same test.
