# Happiness coursera course

## Week 1

Self-reporting about happiness is quite representative. It correlates with other objective metrics.

Concept of happiness is a balloon. If we make mistakes (happiness sins) then the balloon have holes and happiness getting smaller. 
If we inflate the balloon by the good habbits, then we make balloon bigger.

Happiness metric: https://isb.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_23TdZGYzQsfMeYB?user_id=12620598 (35 - max, I got 18).

There are 7 happiness sins.

The first sin is devaluing happiness.

Happiness was rated the highest amoung 12 possible goals (including success, money etc). 
But if you will ask for 3 wishes it normally about money, relationship, fame etc and only 6% ask for happiness.

We can prefer smth which is worse for us, but it costs more, like prefer vegetables over chicken in a salad bar, 
if price is fixed for weight. We can try to prefer being right or prove smth in relations. We sacrifice happiness for other goals.
And those goals aren't that important.

Job-choice. The same idea here. We select smth with more stress/money and less interesting. 
So we devalue happiness there for the material goals.

There are 3 misconceptions about happiness: it makes us lazy, selfish and it won't last for a long time. All of them totally wrond.
Instead we can be more creative and motivated, donate more and we can define happiness in a correct way. It's negative beliefs.

It's can be hard to define happiness concretly and it makes it harder to prioritize.

Medium maximization concept. It's when we focused not on a final goal, but on a medium one. For example, money. 
They don't have value itself, but people have tendency to focus on them.

The idea to overcame davaluing happiness is prioritize but don't pursue happiness.
So we should remind ourselves to prioritize happiness.
But we shouldn't constanly check our happiness level or overthink about it.

My defenition of happiness: feel well physically and mentally, learn new stuff, have a good relations with my family and other people.

Things which make me happy (4 examples):

*  Doing excercies, like tennis, swimming, maybe yoga etc.
*  Learn/deep-dive into new stuff. Cources, books, working on smth etc.
*  Having good "fun".
*  Positive communication with my family and with other people.
