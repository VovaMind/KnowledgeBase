## Overall

Using anaconda (conda). It helps to maintain several enviroments. Is it python-sprecific?

Using cloud computing power with GPUs. Possible option: https://aws.amazon.com/ru/ec2/. You pay for computational time.

<a name="HMM"/>

## HMM (hidden markov models).

Can be very useful. Trick to setup probability distributions inside nodes with some HMM configuration.

Helpful with analysing time series/data.

<a name="DL"/>

## Deep learing notes

Context: classification of points.

Perceptron trick: change weights of a linear function by coordinates of a point, use a class label to modify bias. Use a learning rate.

Perceptron algorithm: making iterations of perceptron trick.

Using error-function for a gradient descent. It should be continuous and differentiable.

## CNN notes
