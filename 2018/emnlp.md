### Joint Multitask Learning for Community Question Answering Using Task-Specific Embeddings

http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1452

Three tasks: determine answer goodness, find answers similarity, answer selection

SemEval

Using task-dependand embeddings

Shared NN part for different tasks

### What Makes Reading Comprehension Questions Easier?

Answer factual questions posed in NL

open domain

search in web-scale data

it's different from text comprehension

Wikipedia is a data source
