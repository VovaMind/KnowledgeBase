# Nonviolent communication (NVC)

## Giving from the heart

NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.

New perception on relationship: hear our deeper needs, hear deeper needs of others.

Ideas: consciousness plays a key role in NVC.

4 components of NVC:

1.  Oberervations.
2.  Feelings.
3.  Needs.
4.  Requests.

It's basically a chain observatio n-> feeling -> need -> request.

Two parts of NVC:

1.  Expressing honestly through the 4 components.
2.  Receiving emphatically through the four components.

It can be applied in many contexts.

## Communication that blocks compassion

Certain ways of communicating alieanate us from our natural state of compassion.

In the world of judgements, our conern centerns on "who is what".

Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.

Classifuing and judging people promotes violence.

Comparisons are a form of judgement.

Our lanuage obscures awareness of personal responsibility.

We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.

We are dangerous when we are not consious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.

We can never make people do anything.

Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication.

Philosophical/political roots for life alienating communcation.

## Observing without evaluating

When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.

Lanuage specific details.

Separate observations from evaluation.

## Identifying and expressing feelings

Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.

Distinguish feelings from thoughts.

Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.

Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave towards us.

## Taking responsibility for our feelings

What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.

4 options for receiving negative messages:

1.  Blame ourselves.
1.  Blame others.
1.  Sense our own feelings and needs.
1.  Sense others's feelings and needs.

Connect with your feeling with your need: "I feel X because I need Y".

Distinguish between giving from the heart and beong motivated by guilt.

Judgements of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.

If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.

If we don't value our needs, others may not either.

Emotional slavery stage: we see ourselves responsible for others' feelings.

Obnoxious stage: we feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others' feelings.

Emotional liberation stage: we take responsibility for our intentions and actions.

## Requesting that which would enrich life

Use positive language when making requests.

Make requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.

Vague language contributes to internal confusion.

Depression is the reward we get for being "good".

When we simply request our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.

We are often not consious of what we are requesting.

Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker's feelings and needs.

The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we'll get it.

To make sure the message we sent is the message that's received, ask the listener to reflect it back.

Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.

Empathize with the listener who doesn't want to reflect back.

After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know what the listener is feeling / what the listener is thinking / whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.

In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren't certain what response there're wanting.

When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: to submit or to rebel.

To tell if it's a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with.

It's a demand, if the speaker then criticizes or judges.

It's a demand, if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.

It's a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person's needs.

Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.

## Receiving empathically

2 parts of NVC: expressign honestly, receiving empathically.

Emphathy: emptying our mind and listing with our whole being.

Ask before offering advice or reassurance.

Intellectual understanding block empathy.

No matter what others say, we only hear what they are (1) obersving (2) feeling (3) needing (4) requesting.

Listening to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.

When asking for information, first exrpess our own feelings and needs.

Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.

Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.

Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs.

A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someones's life.

Paraphrasing saves times.

When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels of themselves.

We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a release of tension, or (2) the flow of words comes to a halt.

We need empathy to give empathy.

## The power of empathy

Empathy allow us to "reperceive our world ina new way and to go on".

Don't just do something...

It's harder to empathize with those, who apper to possess more power, status, or resources.

The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.

We "say a lot" by listening for other people's feelings and needs.

Rather than put your "but" in the face of an angry person, empathize.

When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.

It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.

Empathizing with someone's "no" protects us from taking it personally.

To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.

What bores the listener bores the speaker too.

Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.

Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.

Empathy lies in our ability to be present.

## Connecting compassionately with ourselves

NVC's most important use may be in developing self-compassion.

We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.

Avoid shoulding yourself.

Self-judgements, like all judgements, are tragic expressions of unmet needs.

NVC mourning: connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions we now regret.

NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.

We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part.

We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.

Translating "have to" to "Choose to":

1.  List of "problematic" activities.
1.  Ack that you are doing it, since you "choose to"
1.  I choose to... because I want...

With every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.

Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or approval, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price you pay for them.

The most dangerous of all behavious may consist of doing things "because we are supposed to".

## Express anger fully

Hurting people is too superficial :)

We are never angry because of what others say or do.

To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.

The cause of anger lies in our thinking - in thoughts of blame and judgment.

When we judge others, we contribute to violence.

Use anger as a wake-up call.

Anger co-opts our engergy by diverting it toward punitive actions.

When we become aware of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving feelings.

Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment.

Judgements of others contribute to self-sulfulling prophecies.

Steps to expressing anger:

1.  Stop. Breathe.
2.  Identify our judgmental thoughts.
3.  Connect with our needs.
4.  Express our feelings and unmet needs.

The more we hear them, the more they will hear us.

Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds, without judging them.

When we hear another preson's feelings and needs, we recognize our common humanity.

Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain.

People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault.

Practice translating each judgement into an unmet need.

Take your time.

## Conflict resolution and mediation

Creating a connection between people is the most important thing.

When you make the connection, the problem usually solves itself.

Avoid the use of language that implies wrongness.

Intellectual analysis is often received as criticism.

Learn to hear needs regardless of how people express them.

Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful resolution of conflicts.

People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being said.

Action language requires the use of action verbs.

Maintaining respect is a key element in successful conflict resolution.

The objective is not to get the parties to do what we want them to do.

Use role-play to speed up the mediation process.

Role-play is simply putting ourselves in the other person's shoes.

The purpose of interrupting is to restore the process.

We need to be well practiceied at hearing the need in any message.

## The protective use of force
