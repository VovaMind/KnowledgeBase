# Nonviolent communication (NVC)

## Giving from the heart

NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.

New perception on relationship: hear our deeper needs, hear deeper needs of others.

Ideas: consciousness plays a key role in NVC.

4 components of NVC:

1.  Oberervations.
2.  Feelings.
3.  Needs.
4.  Requests.

It's basically a chain observatio n-> feeling -> need -> request.

Two parts of NVC:

1.  Expressing honestly through the 4 components.
2.  Receiving emphatically through the four components.

It can be applied in many contexts.
