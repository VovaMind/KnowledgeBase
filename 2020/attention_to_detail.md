They include one another from foundation to the highest level.

The basic level is **constrastive**. It's either right or wrong. Yes/no approach. There is only one correct solution. It's fully objective.
Can be fully systematized.

The next level is **analytical**.  Idea: there is a solution here. Requires domain knowledge. Can be partially systematized.
Can be subjective.

The highest level is **additive**.  Idea: make it better. It's very subjective / hard to systematize.

You need to move toward contrastive.
