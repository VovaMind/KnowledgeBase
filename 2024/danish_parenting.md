# Danish way of parenting

## Recognizing our default setting

A lot of stress for kids now.

Our default settings are the actions and reactions we have when we are too tired to choose a better way.

Most of default settings are inherited from our parents.

It's important to obeserve, study, and understand your deafault settings.

Increase our self-aweareness and making concious decisions about our actions and reations.

## Play

Caveat: overprogramming our kids' lives.

Free play teaches children to be less anxious.

Internal vs external locus of control. Internal is better in terms of resilence and mental health.

Give kids the space to learn and grow.

In Denmark, parents try not to intervene unless it's absolutely necessary.

Give space and time, allow children to develop both competence and confidence in their internal locus of control. Pushing kids doesn't help in this regard.

Play allows children regulating their stress. Play helps to develop coping skills.

Lego and playground.

The more they play, the more resilient and socially adept they will become.

Tips for play:

*  Turn off TC and electronics.
*  Create an encriching environment.
*  Use art.
*  Let them explore outside.
*  Mix children of different age.
*  Let them be free and forget the guilt.
*  Be real. Don't afraid to look silly. Let them guide.
*  Let them play alone too.
*  Create an obstacle course.
*  Get other parents involved.
*  Avoid intervening too quickly.
*  Let go. Allow do things by themselves.

## Authenticity

Fairy-tale endings. It's not needed / it's important to understand our own emotions. Stories are a proxy for it.

Honesty with children. All emotions from children are valid. Avoid self-deception.

Being in touch with your emotions. Your goals vs your kid goals. External recognition vs internal motivation.

When praising, focus on the task, rathen than overcomplimenting the child. Focus on the worked involved. 

Nurture a feeling of being able to master a skill instead of already being a master.

Fixed mind-set (that's what I can/have) vs growth mind-set (I can always improve/grow etc). Growth one is improtant in the future career and life.

Praise the process, e.g. you practiced this a lot, that's why you did it well.

Tips for authenticity:

*  Root our self-deception.
*  Answer with honesty.
*  Use examples from your own childhood.
*  Teach honesty.
*  Read the stories that encompass all emotions.
*  Use process praise.
*  Don't use praise as a default response.
*  Focus on effort - and keep it genuine.
*  Teach children not to compare themselves with others.
*  Highlight your perspective, and your child's by saying "for me".

## Reframing

Seeing truth in a new way.

Realistic optimism. The idea is being not too optimistic/pessimistic. Filtering out unnecessary negative information. Focusing on the less negative aspects of situations.

Skill of reframing. We feel what we think. 

Less limiting language, e.g. I'm X.

Reframing and children. Create different / positive / encouraging narrative. Framing -> behaviour. Power of labels.

Use supportive language: it will help children to understand reasons for their emotions and actions.

Brighter side of things. 

Don't tell them how to feel.

Using humor is a powerful tool.

Tip for reframing:

*  Pay attention to your negativity.
*  Practice reframing.
*  Use less limiting language.
*  Separate actions from person.
*  Rewrite your child's narrative to be more loving.
*  Use supporting language. Ask questions. 
*  Use humor.

## Empathy

Survival of the fittest is a frequent cultural focus.

Fear of vulnerability.

Be more connected.

We are all wired for empathy.

Fostering empathy in children early on helps them create better, more caring relationships in the future.

Special classes in Danish schools for empathy.

Trusting is very freeing.

Tips for empathy are:

*  Understand your own empathic style.
*  Understand others.
*  Notice and attempt to identify emptions.
*  Read more. It's important for children.
*  Improve meaningful relationships.
*  Be vulnerable.
*  Seek out empathy in others.

## No ultimatums

4 parenting styles:

*  Authoritarian. Demanding and not responsive.
*  Authoritative. Demanding but responsive. (optimal one)
*  Permissive. Not demanding but responsive.
*  Uninvolved. Neither demanding nor responsive.

Seeing children as intrinsically good.

Parenting with respect.

Calm begets calm.

Discuss the rules with children and stick to it.

Avoiding power struggles. 

Don' treat the child in a way in which you wouldn't want to be treated.

Stop worrying about what others think.

Chill out.

Example: offer a way out.

Dinnertime often leads to a power struggle.

Explain the rules and ask for understanding.

Try to avoid yelling.

Tips for no ultimatums are:

*  Remember to distinguish the behaviour from the child.

## Togetherness and hygge

Hygge - to cozy around together.

Feeling connected to others gives meaning and purpose to our lives.

American culture / too much focus on ourselves.

Social ties reduce the stress level.

Tips for simplicity, being cozy etc.
