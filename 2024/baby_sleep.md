## Why child won't sleep

It's ok at the early stage (till ~6 month) - the child is too small.

Common issues are: resistance to sleep, waking up multiple times during the night, staying awake at night, fighting daytime sleep, taking very short naps.

Two major factors are parental dependencies: they need a lot of parental input for sleep, timing for sleep.

Typical dependencies are: bottles, nursing, parental presence, buggy/car, roker chair, dummy, parental bed, holding, hand holding, rubbing, couch.

Brain checks for dependencies: things aren't same -> alert.

Timing: biological periods, overtiredness.

overtiredness signals: intense eye rubbing, aching the bcak, becoming agitated or impatient, unreasonable and non-compliant, not knowning what they want.

When a child is overtired -> it's too late -> you need to react earlier.

Looking for tired signals, they can be subtle: quick eye rub, brief yawn, moment of quiet- zooming out, staring into space. This is easy to miss / might be not even there.

Tired state indicates sleep readiness.

Rountines are the key.

## Getting started

Child should be 100% well.

Many factors: vaccinations, teething.

You ideally need a stable period of 3-4 weeks without big changes.

Friday is a good start - weekend is ahead, so you are more flexible.

Outdoor activity is important. 1h per day is a minimum. 30 min in the morning + 30 min in the afternoon.

For older children - encorage high-level activity during the day.

Figure out the sleeping setup: parent bedroom, their bedroom, cot, bed.

Room sharing with an older child -> curtain might be useful.

Sticking to cot for a longer period is usually a good idea: till 2.5-3 years. Own bed might happen too soon.

Most children from 18 months can begin to understand simple instructions. Self-control appears later -> so child might understand you, but it's not reliable.

Keep a sleep log.
