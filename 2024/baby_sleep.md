# The baby sleep solution, points

## Why child won't sleep

It's ok at the early stage (till ~6 month) - the child is too small.

Common issues are: resistance to sleep, waking up multiple times during the night, staying awake at night, fighting daytime sleep, taking very short naps.

Two major factors are parental dependencies: they need a lot of parental input for sleep, timing for sleep.

Typical dependencies are: bottles, nursing, parental presence, buggy/car, roker chair, dummy, parental bed, holding, hand holding, rubbing, couch.

Brain checks for dependencies: things aren't same -> alert.

Timing: biological periods, overtiredness.

overtiredness signals: intense eye rubbing, aching the bcak, becoming agitated or impatient, unreasonable and non-compliant, not knowning what they want.

When a child is overtired -> it's too late -> you need to react earlier.

Looking for tired signals, they can be subtle: quick eye rub, brief yawn, moment of quiet- zooming out, staring into space. This is easy to miss / might be not even there.

Tired state indicates sleep readiness.

Rountines are the key.

## Getting started

Child should be 100% well.

Many factors: vaccinations, teething.

You ideally need a stable period of 3-4 weeks without big changes.

Friday is a good start - weekend is ahead, so you are more flexible.

Outdoor activity is important. 1h per day is a minimum. 30 min in the morning + 30 min in the afternoon.

For older children - encorage high-level activity during the day.

Figure out the sleeping setup: parent bedroom, their bedroom, cot, bed.

Room sharing with an older child -> curtain might be useful.

Sticking to cot for a longer period is usually a good idea: till 2.5-3 years. Own bed might happen too soon.

Most children from 18 months can begin to understand simple instructions. Self-control appears later -> so child might understand you, but it's not reliable.

Keep a sleep log.

## Creating positive sleep support

Room acclimatisation is important. Allocate at least 30 mins per day to roomactivities during non-sleep time.

Cot acclimatisation exercises.

Security item. You need to wear it with you. It must be breatheable and washable, e.g. a piece of muslin cloth.

Involve the security item in the bedtime routine.

Dummy. It can be very helpful during first months. It reduces the risk of SIDS.

Dummy might cause problems after the first 4-5 months: baby needs your help with re-plugging.

Typically dummy night runs are caused by bad day sleep / child being too tired.

6 months+ - one can consider disconnecting from dummy. It can be replaced by a security item.

You can teach the child to be independent with dummy: put it in their hand and guide their hand to their mouth.

One can reduce dummy befor 12 month, after that it might take until the child is 2-2.5 years.

Reducing dummy time during the day is the first step.

Dummy retrieval - have spare ones. Child can through this away as a game, doesn't allow it. Wait 3-5 minutes and then put it to the coat and guide the child. Don't be verbal with it.

Coonected play and one-to-one time are important. Allocate 20 minutes of exclusive time. Face-to-face is important. A lot of eye and physical contact.  Get down  on the floor. Let them lead the play. Don't be distracted.

Sleep environment:

*  The room should be dark.
*  Night light (4W) - dim light. Child should be able to see their hand in front of their face.
*  Remove distractions: toys, mobiles, mirrors, hanging things, wardrobe door left open, hanging clothes. Lie on the child level and observe. Basically cot should contain the baby, bedding, and security item.
*  Use a baby monitor.
*  Regulate temperature and the clothes. General recommendation is 16-20 degree.
*  Clothing for sleep. Sleeping bag is a good idea.

Bedtime routine. It's a bridge between wakefulness and sleep. It's also useful for naps. You need an order of events, which you need to consistently follow.

Bedroom is a good place for the bedtime routine. 20-30 minutes for relaxing. Dim light is important for it.

Bedtime routime can be strarted from 6 weeks of age. No TV/electronics.

Ideal routine includes the following steps:

*  Quite the house an hour before the sleep. one-to-one time with the child.
*  Finish the feed 45 minutes before the sleep to avoid assosiations.
*  Consider a bath, face wash, teeth brush.
*  Bedroom is a good place.
*  Consider white noise during routine.
*  Baby massage or relaxing excercised for an older child.
*  Change the annpy, put on the pyjamas, get them to the sleeping bag.
*  Sing a particular song or say the same words over.
*  Quiet readong or story-time. Tone is more important than the words.
*  Simple games are also an option, e.g. puzzles, blocks, cups etc.
*  20-30 minutes wind-down.
*  Have a specific end for the routine: words / lights etc. It will signal the end of the routine.
*  Place the child to their cot. Relaxed, but awake.

Music: white noise ot lullaby music. It can work as a sleep assosiation. Either bedtime routine or the whole night.

## Gentle sleep shaping

New babies need a lot of sleep: 12-16h per day. It's often not in long intervals.

New baby need lots of assitance to achieve sleep. Better sleep patterns should come soon after it.

You can work on sleep foundations with a new baby.

Actual sleep learning excercises are sutable for 6+ months.

Safe sleep and SIDS risks:

*  Always put the baby on their back. If they can roll over, then they can find they sleep position.
*  Smoking / bed sharing are risk factors.
*  Safest sleep place: your bedroom and cot for at least 6 months.
*  Remove extra items from the cot.
*  Don't let baby get too hot. Cellular cotton blankets are the best.
*  New baby doesn't need a pillow.
*  Breastfeeding reduces the risk.
*  Consider a dummy.
*  Tummy time during the day with supervision.
*  Car seats, swings, infant seats aren't optimal for sleep.

Structure and routine are important.

Waking should happen before 7 a.m. / 7.30 a.m.

Learning to read baby's sleep language: find a moment when a baby is getting tired.

There are no bad habbits during the early days. New baby needs a lot of support from you: rocking, holding, comforting.

Motion makes baby happy: use hands, swings, seats, excercise ball.

Dummy helps to calm baby down.

Small space for sleep is good at the beginning: they will feel safe.

Room sharing for the first 6 months.

Baby moving -> start thinking about safety strategies.

React and adjust for child's temperament and needs.

Bedtime ritual is important: dim lights, change nappy/dress, sing songs, use a certain mantra, feed, put to the sleeping space.

Percentage of wakefulness approach: put baby to the cot more awake than asleep to encourage the ability to rely less on parents for going to sleep.
Encorage them to do some work for falling asleep themselves.
Babies who learn to go to sleep with minimal parental input would sleep better.
e.g. now awake initially, then 5% awake etc.
The best time to establish this approach is between 8 and 12 weeks of age.
Try again, if initial response wasn't positive.

In the first 4-6 weeks teach the difference between day and night. 10-12 weeks - daytime structure might appear.

Getting outside helps, especially in afternoon.

Baby massage helps to fall asleep.

Encourage tummy time from 6th week.

## Stay and support sleep learning approach

6 months  - 2.5 years period is relevant.

It's important to combine this with the correct schedule of naps and feeds.

Take small steps. It can be challenging in the short term.

Any parent can start, decide on the specific situation.

Usual stuff for the start: feed in advance, bedtime routine, lights off, white noise, put your child into the cot (awake but relaxed).

You can either start it right away, or come back and do it. Retuning to the room is normal.

It can be used for both overnight and naps.

Position youself at the child level (floor, chair etc). Idea: comfort, reassure, support, and emotionally engage as they learn the sleeping process.

Make yourself coomfortable: it takes time.

Physical response is good. Ideas: stroke the temples, stroke the bridge of the nose, rub the back of the neck, pat, fingers walk, tummy, tom-tom, roll, wiggle.

Balance between supporting and creating sleep associations.

Don't allow falling to sleep with touching a parent.

Verbal responses are good. Broken record technique: repeat the same thing again and again.

Maintain an eye contact.

Use distraction. Idea: stop crying, crying and sleep aren't related. Try to create a momnet of calm and pause from crying. 

Distraction tricks: gently blow on their face, band the bars of the cot / floor, drum on the matteess, use white noise (loud->calmer), put their chest to change the crying vibration.

Use other techniques during pockets of calm.

Child standing: from 9 months they might able to stand or pull themselves up. Don't get into power struggle!

Ideas: more activity during the day, use key words and phrases, teach them to going from standing to sitting.

How to respond:

*  Allow them to do it, comoft them, put them down once and return to the low position.
*  Encourage them to come down on their own. Pat the mattress and stay down low.
*  Wait till your child comes down.
*  If a child gets sleep or dozy - you can help them.

Picking up is ok, but it might create a dependency. 20-30 minutes cycle. Don't allow to fall asleep in your arms.

Don't walk away during the pick up. 2-3 calm breaths -> return to the cot. Don't lift them up immediately once they are upset.

Don't leave them until they are asleep. Wait till they breathe regularly, 10 minutes after falling asleep is usually safe.

## 2.5-6 years old
