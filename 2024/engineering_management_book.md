# Engineering management for the rest of us

## Your team

Enabling everyone around you.

Caring about the team is critical.

## Values

Values are our fundamental believes. It affects our motivation, drive, actions. Values affect behaviour and ethics.

Values are the context, so we can undestand what is happening and why.

Sharing values can be a side effect of building trust, vulnerability within the team.

Excercise/workshop for values.

It's important to understand your own values.

Companies have values. Teams have values.

Clarity is key.

Misalignment with too many fundamental values can lead to burnout.

## Trust and vulnerability

Enabling the people to do their best work together.

Trust is essential for multiple things:

*  Hearing each other out.
*  Finding the human in the mistakes.
*  Creativity.
*  Making job more enjoyable.

Vulnerability. You as a leader have to go first.

Individual trust. It can be tricky for some folks.

Team trust.

Weekly team time:

*  Brief standup twice weekly is a good start.
*  Let folks just chat.
*  Jokes can be a good ice breaker.

Team only spaces. It's good for psychological safety.

## them vs we

Problems that your are solving as a manager aren't about you. 

We are "we" as a team.

Organizational health lies in being able to work together.

Leadership team should be treated as your team.

Managers should drive balance and clarity.

Saying we holds you accountable for leadership decisions.

Humility and taking responsbility are important.

## Happiness and drive
