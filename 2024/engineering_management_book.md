# Engineering management for the rest of us, points

## Your team

Enabling everyone around you.

Caring about the team is critical.

## Values

Values are our fundamental believes. It affects our motivation, drive, actions. Values affect behaviour and ethics.

Values are the context, so we can undestand what is happening and why.

Sharing values can be a side effect of building trust, vulnerability within the team.

Excercise/workshop for values.

It's important to understand your own values.

Companies have values. Teams have values.

Clarity is key.

Misalignment with too many fundamental values can lead to burnout.

## Trust and vulnerability

Enabling the people to do their best work together.

Trust is essential for multiple things:

*  Hearing each other out.
*  Finding the human in the mistakes.
*  Creativity.
*  Making job more enjoyable.

Vulnerability. You as a leader have to go first.

Individual trust. It can be tricky for some folks.

Team trust.

Weekly team time:

*  Brief standup twice weekly is a good start.
*  Let folks just chat.
*  Jokes can be a good ice breaker.

Team only spaces. It's good for psychological safety.

## them vs we

Problems that your are solving as a manager aren't about you. 

We are "we" as a team.

Organizational health lies in being able to work together.

Leadership team should be treated as your team.

Managers should drive balance and clarity.

Saying we holds you accountable for leadership decisions.

Humility and taking responsbility are important.

## Happiness and drive

Culture and morale on your team is a large part of your responsibility.

Toxic positivity / false harmony.

Flow state.

Trust your team with authonomy to drive outcomes.

Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

Social connection.

Peer / mob programming. Sharing context. Helps to connect remote teams.

Dealing with negative bias: stick to facts, focus on positive, reject negative premises, review consequences aka it's not too bad, step away if needed.

Incremental habits. Habits take very little effort for our mind.

People can grow.

## Long-term care

Doing all by yourself isn't an optimal way forward.

Listen more than talk.

Inclusive leadership stages: unaware, aware, active, advocate.

Trust is inclusion.

Culture as strong as its worst behaviour tolerated. It's your job to speak up.

Their goals.

## Career laddering

Ladder alone won't work: you need to put them into action.

Big piture is a first step.

Career laddering review is a 2nd step. Self-assessement should be a part of it.

3rd step is 30/60/90. It's a plan for the amount of days. Start with a bigger period.

Promo is an indicator of success.

Anything which provides clarity might be helpful.

Team as an ecosystem.

## 1:1s are crtitical

It helps to reduce uncertainty by making both folks more connected to the rest of the team.

1:1 meetings are the most important part of the job.

Avoid distractions.

Make people feel valuable and connected.

Prioritize, make AIs, clarify vision.

Connection is an important need.

1:1 are more for reports than for managers. It's chance to speak freely.

Agendas are required.

## Communicating as a manager

Leading without driving. 

Your job is to align people on outcomes not figure out tactical details. What vs how.

Ask questions.

Alignment on why.

Trick: convey the same message in different ways.

Think of it from the audience perspective.

Format things clearly.

Be careful with words.

Be transparent.

## Change management

Change for the better is not just possible, but necessary.

In order to make transformation, the culture has to shift to allow for it.

This might be challenging and it will take a lot of consistent work.

Communicate why for connecting people and making this possible.

Seek to understand.

Be specific about why the changes are made.

You might feel crisis of confidence at some point.

Support people to grow the skills they need in order to succeed.

Be accountable.

Often leaders take too long to act, or act too brashly.

Long term vs short term.

Respect the back channel. Folks might have a perception of unfair decision-making.

## Giving feedback

Different types of feedback: talk between 2 people, comment on a doc, emotional reactions from others etc.

In terms of feedback, there is a bit of netural tension within our own egos.

Key part is to establish partnership.

Tricky part is to make them don't feel threatened.

Stress -> reduced analytical thinking, creativity, and worse problem problem solving.

Giving and receiving feedback is a challenge. Be careful and thoughful.

Suggestions/steps are:

1.  Pre-work: how would they prefer receiving feedback.
2.  Make sure that it's necessary.
3.  Check-in your motivation and biases.
4.  Give it as soon as you can.
5.  Keep conversation open / allow asking questions.
6.  Talk through expectations and improvement suggestions. Clear next steps and follow-ups.

Be specific, what can be improved and why. Connect feedback to their values and goals.

Will this feedback help them in the long term?

Praise in public, feedback in private.

Record the facts.

## Receiving feedback

Solicit feedback: anonymous form, ask in a group about a project/event, ask for feedback in 1:1.

This is hard

Defensiveness is a natural reaction.

Blind spots.

Ego resilience.

Don't mix together receiving and giving feedback.

Write everything down.

Stepping back is hard. You are within bounds to leave the conversation.

## Good meetings

Bad meetings: no clear purpose/direction, chaotic, wrong people attending, no repect, feels like a waste of time.

Good meetings are opposite :)

Prepare agenda.

Different types of meetings, e.g. cross-funtional, regular meetings/standups, brainstorming.

Building atmosphere / trust in the team.

Disambiguate healthy conflicts from attacks, keep the discussion respectful.

Directly responsibile individuals / owners. It's a useful framework.

DACI framework: driver, improver, contributor, informed.

RACI: responsible, accountable, consulted, informed.

RAPID: recommend, aggree, perform, input, decide.

## Managing conflicts

False harmony vs productive conflict.

Act immediately.

Separate ideas from identity.

Conflict and underlying values.

Create psychological safety.

Finilize decisions.

## Collaboration: cross-team, open source

Different perspectives: maintainer, contributor.

## Prioritizing your team's work

It's important to know what to do first / what to focus on for better execution.

Prioritize your own time.

OKRs.

Breaking OKRs down to more tangible tasks.

Quaterly planning.

Limitations of metrics.

Everything is important - > nothing is important.

Understand your highest goals, be willing to drop other stuff.

## Scope down PRs

Easier to review, test, iterate.

Tracking what is left.

## Speed of execution

Set direction first.

Minimal viable product aka MVP.

How to more quickly:

*  Assess motivation.
*  Assess psychological safety.
*  Assess tech stack.
*  Align the team with company's goals (the why).

## Splitting time between product/engineering work

Conflicts between product and engineering might happen.

Engineers might not understand what's expected of them.

Maintenance/ownership should be clear.

Write small one-pagers (one-sheeters) to keep everyone on the same page.

Focus vs split time on different activities.

Tech debt. Up front communication about upcoming PRs.

Innovative products vs communication.

Migrations and relevant communication/planning/maintainance etc.

Celebrate!

## Prioritizing: high level

What is the most important thing? What to work on at all?

What we work on -> expression of our values.

Your actions show you what you actually want. Two reactions on it:

*  Admit your real priorities / don't lie to yourself.
*  Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's actually true.

Quadrants for thinking about tasks. It could be impact/effort one, or classes based on priorities/values like making money, peronal fulfilment etc. Multiple classes -> good sign.

Something can be dropped by quadrants. It helps to bring clarify: where to invest your energy, where not to invest.

Values should be reflected in what you schedule.

Energy level affects prioritization. Awareness is the first step. Apply findings to your calendar.

Context shifting and batching.

Give yourself grace: no one can do everything, balance is always imperfect.

## Prioritizing: day to day

Task prioritization list is:

*  Actively on fire or time-sensitive.
*  Can be done quickly.
*  Needs a scheduled block of time.
*  Can get further along.

Morale is important, it comes from things being done.

Find a system that motivates you and allows to be proud of the progress; despite new things are appearing all the time.

Give yourself a credit.

Know yourself.

## Setting boundaries

Saying no.

Too many meetings.

Forgive yourself.

Don't compare yourself with other people.

Make decisions that are right for you; trust yourself to know wnat you need.

## Filling your cup

Self-care.

Finding joy to become more resilient.

Gratitude journaling.

## Believing in yorself

Surrounding yourself with people who believe in you. Make sure that you support them too.

Coaching and mentorship.

Giving back / volunteering.
