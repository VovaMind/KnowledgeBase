# Engineering management for the rest of us, points

## Your team

Enabling everyone around you.

Caring about the team is critical.

## Values

Values are our fundamental believes. It affects our motivation, drive, actions. Values affect behaviour and ethics.

Values are the context, so we can undestand what is happening and why.

Sharing values can be a side effect of building trust, vulnerability within the team.

Excercise/workshop for values.

It's important to understand your own values.

Companies have values. Teams have values.

Clarity is key.

Misalignment with too many fundamental values can lead to burnout.

## Trust and vulnerability

Enabling the people to do their best work together.

Trust is essential for multiple things:

*  Hearing each other out.
*  Finding the human in the mistakes.
*  Creativity.
*  Making job more enjoyable.

Vulnerability. You as a leader have to go first.

Individual trust. It can be tricky for some folks.

Team trust.

Weekly team time:

*  Brief standup twice weekly is a good start.
*  Let folks just chat.
*  Jokes can be a good ice breaker.

Team only spaces. It's good for psychological safety.

## them vs we

Problems that your are solving as a manager aren't about you. 

We are "we" as a team.

Organizational health lies in being able to work together.

Leadership team should be treated as your team.

Managers should drive balance and clarity.

Saying we holds you accountable for leadership decisions.

Humility and taking responsbility are important.

## Happiness and drive

Culture and morale on your team is a large part of your responsibility.

Toxic positivity / false harmony.

Flow state.

Trust your team with authonomy to drive outcomes.

Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

Social connection.

Peer / mob programming. Sharing context. Helps to connect remote teams.

Dealing with negative bias: stick to facts, focus on positive, reject negative premises, review consequences aka it's not too bad, step away if needed.

Incremental habits. Habits take very little effort for our mind.

People can grow.

## Long-term care

Doing all by yourself isn't an optimal way forward.

Listen more than talk.

Inclusive leadership stages: unaware, aware, active, advocate.

Trust is inclusion.

Culture as strong as its worst behaviour tolerated. It's your job to speak up.

Their goals.

## Career laddering

Ladder alone won't work: you need to put them into action.

Big piture is a first step.

Career laddering review is a 2nd step. Self-assessement should be a part of it.

3rd step is 30/60/90. It's a plan for the amount of days. Start with a bigger period.

Promo is an indicator of success.

Anything which provides clarity might be helpful.

Team as an ecosystem.

## 1:1s are crtitical

It helps to reduce uncertainty by making both folks more connected to the rest of the team.

1:1 meetings are the most important part of the job.

Avoid distractions.

Make people feel valuable and connected.

Prioritize, make AIs, clarify vision.

Connection is an important need.

1:1 are more for reports than for managers. It's chance to speak freely.

Agendas are required.

## Communicating as a manager

Leading without driving. 

Your job is to align people on outcomes not figure out tactical details. What vs how.

Ask questions.

Alignment on why.

Trick: convey the same message in different ways.

Think of it from the audience perspective.

Format things clearly.

Be careful with words.

Be transparent.

## Change management

Change for the better is not just possible, but necessary.

In order to make transformation, the culture has to shift to allow for it.

This might be challenging and it will take a lot of consistent work.

Communicate why for connecting people and making this possible.

Seek to understand.

Be specific about why the changes are made.

You might feel crisis of confidence at some point.

Support people to grow the skills they need in order to succeed.

Be accountable.

Often leaders take too long to act, or act too brashly.

Long term vs short term.

Respect the back channel. Folks might have a perception of unfair decision-making.

## Giving feedback

Different types of feedback: talk between 2 people, comment on a doc, emotional reactions from others etc.

In terms of feedback, there is a bit of netural tension within our own egos.

Key part is to establish partnership.
