# Whole brain child

## Survive and thrive

Not only survival mode, but an opportunity to help

## Keeping brain in mind

Caring about body, not much about mind.

Concept of integration:

*    Multiple part of your brain, akin to multiple personalities: rational, irrational, reflective, reactive etc.
*    Make different parts of the brain work together as a whole. Analogy: different organs working together. Doing individual jobs while working together.
*    Working together in a coordinated and balaned way.

It's easy to see when kids aren't integrated: overwhelmed by emotions, confused and chaotic. They can't respond calmly.

Different types of integration:

*   Horizontal: left brain logic + right brain emotion.
*   Vertical: high parts (considering actions) + lower parts (instinct, gut reactions, survival).

Brain adapts to better integration, especially one of a child: wiring and rewiring.

Examples are: 

*    Talking about their experiences -> better access to the relevant memories.
*    Talking about feelings -> emotional intelligence development.
*    Shy children + offering supportive exploration of the world -> it gets better.

Everything affects brain developement: texting, TV, education, sport, music, family/friends time etc.

Children need time to develop their brains. You need to wait for improvements, regardless of parenting strategies.

Using everyday moments -> help with integration.

Flow concept:

*   Two shores: chaos and rigidity. Navigating waters between them.
*   River of well-being.
*   Mental health is between these shores. Both shores are bad.
*   Chaos = you are out of control / lack of control.
*   Rigidity = imposing control / unwilling to adapt, compromise, or negotiate.

## Integrating left and right
