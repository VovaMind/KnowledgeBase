# Whole brain child

## Survive and thrive

Not only survival mode, but an opportunity to help

## Keeping brain in mind

Caring about body, not much about mind.

Concept of integration:

*    Multiple part of your brain, akin to multiple personalities: rational, irrational, reflective, reactive etc.
*    Make different parts of the brain work together as a whole. Analogy: different organs working together. Doing individual jobs while working together.
*    Working together in a coordinated and balaned way.

It's easy to see when kids aren't integrated: overwhelmed by emotions, confused and chaotic. They can't respond calmly.

Different types of integration:

*   Horizontal: left brain logic + right brain emotion.
*   Vertical: high parts (considering actions) + lower parts (instinct, gut reactions, survival).

Brain adapts to better integration, especially one of a child: wiring and rewiring.

Examples are: 

*    Talking about their experiences -> better access to the relevant memories.
*    Talking about feelings -> emotional intelligence development.
*    Shy children + offering supportive exploration of the world -> it gets better.

Everything affects brain developement: texting, TV, education, sport, music, family/friends time etc.

Children need time to develop their brains. You need to wait for improvements, regardless of parenting strategies.

Using everyday moments -> help with integration.

Flow concept:

*   Two shores: chaos and rigidity. Navigating waters between them.
*   River of well-being.
*   Mental health is between these shores. Both shores are bad.
*   Chaos = you are out of control / lack of control.
*   Rigidity = imposing control / unwilling to adapt, compromise, or negotiate.

## Integrating left and right

Left brain is about order: logical, literal, linguistic, linear (put things in sequence/order).

Right brain is holistic and nonverbal. Reading facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice, posture, gestures. "gut feeling".

Left: letter of the law. Right: spirit of the law. text / context.

Children are right brain dominant, especially during first 3 years. Not much logic, responsibilities, time. Asking why -> left part starts working.

Horizonal integration: left+right. It's important to use both.

The goal is aboid both emotinal flood and desert.

Denial of emotions -> left brain used too much.

Integration opportunities.

### Strategy #1: connect and redirect

Emotional wave situation.

Connecting right brain to right brain.

If a child is upset, logic often won't work until we have responded to the roght brain's emotional needs. Feel felt.

1.    Connect to the Right. Acknowledge feelings. Non-verbal signals.
2.    Rediret with the Left.

It doesn't always work, e.g. too far gone.

Staying in boudnaries is still important, even if a child is upset.

### Strategy #2: name it to tame it

Help to retell the story of unpleasant experiences.

Retelling -> engaging left brain.

Child might not want to do it, and it's ok.

If a child shares a story, this is a valuable tool to process things in a healthy way.

Storytelling helps to understand ourselves and our world by using both parts of the brain.

Putting narrative details in order -> left brain activation.

Works well also for older kids.
