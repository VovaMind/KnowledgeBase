# Whole brain child

## Survive and thrive

Not only survival mode, but an opportunity to help

## Keeping brain in mind

Caring about body, not much about mind.

Concept of integration:

*    Multiple part of your brain, akin to multiple personalities: rational, irrational, reflective, reactive etc.
*    Make different parts of the brain work together as a whole. Analogy: different organs working together. Doing individual jobs while working together.
*    Working together in a coordinated and balaned way.

It's easy to see when kids aren't integrated: overwhelmed by emotions, confused and chaotic. They can't respond calmly.

Different types of integration:

*   Horizontal: left brain logic + right brain emotion.
*   Vertical: high parts (considering actions) + lower parts (instinct, gut reactions, survival).

Brain adapts to better integration, especially one of a child: wiring and rewiring.

Examples are: 

*    Talking about their experiences -> better access to the relevant memories.
*    Talking about feelings -> emotional intelligence development.
*    Shy children + offering supportive exploration of the world -> it gets better.

Everything affects brain developement: texting, TV, education, sport, music, family/friends time etc.

Children need time to develop their brains. You need to wait for improvements, regardless of parenting strategies.

Using everyday moments -> help with integration.

Flow concept:

*   Two shores: chaos and rigidity. Navigating waters between them.
*   River of well-being.
*   Mental health is between these shores. Both shores are bad.
*   Chaos = you are out of control / lack of control.
*   Rigidity = imposing control / unwilling to adapt, compromise, or negotiate.

## Integrating left and right

Left brain is about order: logical, literal, linguistic, linear (put things in sequence/order).

Right brain is holistic and nonverbal. Reading facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice, posture, gestures. "gut feeling".

Left: letter of the law. Right: spirit of the law. text / context.

Children are right brain dominant, especially during first 3 years. Not much logic, responsibilities, time. Asking why -> left part starts working.

Horizonal integration: left+right. It's important to use both.

The goal is aboid both emotinal flood and desert.

Denial of emotions -> left brain used too much.

Integration opportunities.

### Strategy #1: connect and redirect

Emotional wave situation.

Connecting right brain to right brain.

If a child is upset, logic often won't work until we have responded to the roght brain's emotional needs. Feel felt.

1.    Connect to the Right. Acknowledge feelings. Non-verbal signals.
2.    Rediret with the Left.

It doesn't always work, e.g. too far gone.

Staying in boudnaries is still important, even if a child is upset.

### Strategy #2: name it to tame it

Help to retell the story of unpleasant experiences.

Retelling -> engaging left brain.

Child might not want to do it, and it's ok.

If a child shares a story, this is a valuable tool to process things in a healthy way.

Storytelling helps to understand ourselves and our world by using both parts of the brain.

Putting narrative details in order -> left brain activation.

Works well also for older kids.

## Integrating upstais and downstrais brain

*   Upstairs brain: thjnking, planning, imaggining, decision making, control over body and emotions, self-understanding, empathy, morality.
*   Dowstairs brain: anger, fear, breathing, blinking.
*   Amygdala: lower part of the brain. Quickly process and express emotions, especially anger and fear. Enables acting before thinking.

It's important to integrate vertically: bottom-up and top-down are both important flows.

It takes time to master it: don't expect quick results.

Acting before thinking isn't always bad, e.g. dangerous situations. But it's a bad idea in many social scenarios.

Amygdala activates and blocks connection to upstais brain from downstairs. 

Tantrum - try to switch their attention.

Tantrums types:

*   Coming from upstairs brain (concious decision). It's a call for setting clear boundaries, and a follow-up discussion. Firm refusal helps to mitigate this problem.
*   Coming from downstairs brain. Child isn't able to use their upstairs brain. Nurturing and comforting. No sense in talking - upstairs brain isn't there. Once upstairs brain is brack, talking might be a good idea.

Tantrums aren't unique for todlers.

### Strategy #3: Engage, don't enrage: appealing to the upstairs brain

Which part of the brain do I want to appeal to? Example: force to do something vs find a way to negotiate.

In some cases there is no place for negotiation: respecting parents' authority.

Not presenting ultimatum, but redirecting, e.g. ask to describe their feelings.

Ideas: convince me, come up with a solution that works for both of us. It gives kids a chance to practice problem solving and decision making, considring appropriate behaviours, think about others etc.

### Strategy #4: Use it or lose it: excercising the upstairs brain

Help children to excercise upstrairs brain.

*   Sound decision making. Which clothes do you want to pick? Make a choice if there is a scheduling conflict. Buying something now vs saving for a bigger buy later on.
*   Controlling emotions and the body. Deep breath / count to ten. Teach them about brain functioning.  Let them express their feelings.
*   Self-understanding. Why did you make this choice? What made you feel this way? Test difficulty: tricky question / rushing with solution too much.
*   Empathy. Ask kids about feeling of other people, and reasons behind it.
*   Morality. Play hypothetical situations. What are you modeling with your behaviour.

### Strategy #5: Move it or lose it: moving the body to avoid losing your mind

Ask them to move their body.

Changing physical state: movement or relaxation. It can help to change our emotional state.

## Integrating memory for growth and healing

Myths about memory are:

*   Mental file cabinet concept. Reality: memory triggers. Triggered memory creates expectations for the future.
*   Photocopy machine. Reality: altering happens.

Experience -> neurons are getting activated. Linkage creates associations. 

Implicit memory: automatic actions. Explicit memory: active thinking process.  Example: changing diapers. At first: it's hard an detailed (explicit), later on it's automatic (implicit).

Usually memory refers to explicit memory: conscious recollection of the past.

Implicit memories are tricky: thry create expectations based on our previous experiences. 

Kid reacts in unsually unreasonable ways: it might be implicit memory.

Idea: tell the story, create a narative to help their implicit memories to become explicit. It helps to deal with fears.

Integrating implicit and explicit.

Problem: we might not be aware of painful/negative experiences which affect our life.

Hippocampus: part of the brain which integrates explicit and implicit memories / search engine for our memories or a puzzle assembler.

Memory: many scattered puzzle pieces.

It's a tool, not a silver bullet which can solve all the problems.

HALT principle begore digging deeeper: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired.

### Strategy #6L use the remote of the mind
