# Simplicity parenting points

## intro

Too much: too much stuff, too many choices, too much information, too much speed.

Waldorf model was a basis here.

Recognizing overload.

It's never too late.

## why simplify

Simplication helps to protect the environment which allow for a child to slowly (which is essential) unfolding themselves.

Our society puts pressure of "too much" - it's problematic for child's development.

Pace of the daily life is usally and increasingly misaligned with the pace of childhood.

Protected childhood allows for the slow development of identity, well-being, and resiliency.

Families need inspiration, fresh infusions of hope, and imagination. Our daily life might disconnect us from this.

Simplification is a signal of change. It helps to realign our hopes and our everyday life.

Too much stuff leads to too little time and too little depth in the way kids see and explore their worlds.

Children are quirky :)

Stress can push children along the behaviorral spectrum. When you simplify a child's life on many levels, it helps.

The central struggle for parents: let our hopes for kids outweight our fears.

Behavioral tendencies can be soothed or relawxed by crearing calm.

Recommendations for home are:

*  Time moves a bit slower.
*  Everything is less cluttered and more visually relaxing.
*  Space and time for childhood, time for one another.
*  Play and exploration are allowed and appreciated.
*  Having more ease. Limit distractions. Say no to too much, too fast, too soon.
*  Sense of calm and security.
*  Atmospehere of attention, protection, and appreciation.

## soul fever

Comparison between pshysical fever and soul fever.

How to help: simplifications.

Noticing. 1st step. Ignoring symptoms could make it worse.

Quieting things down. Quiet weekend (maybe 3 days) is a good start / might be enough.

Bringing them close. Children need care. Quiet assurance and our presence/availability are important. The safest/most peaceful place: home or other.

There are many factors which could cause it.

Running its course. Such issues have their own duration. It's normal/natural, give it time.

A slow, strong return. You would notice their improvements after it. Carving time for children - emphasis on connection.

Recommendations are:

*  You would notice and respond, when something isn't right.
*  Suspend normal routines, when children are overwhelmed (physically or emotionally).
*  Take care for them: bring close, watch etc in case of well-being issues.
*  kinds can afford time to get better/recover.
*  You would love and look beyond their less-than-best selves.

## Evironemnt

Media pressure/influence on both kids and parents.

Too much stuff leads to too many choices.

The number of toys your child sees, and has access to, should be dramatically reduced.

As you decrease the quanity of your child's toys and clutter, you increase their attention and their capacity for deep play.

An avalance of toys invites emotional disconnect and a sense of overwhelm.

If you give a child less and less complexity, they become more interested, and this cultivates true power of attention.

Discard pile rules are:

*  Broken toys.
*  Developmentally inappropriate toys.
*  Conpetually "fixed" toys.
*  Toys that "do too much" and break too easily.
*  Very high-stimulation toys.
*  Annoying/offensive toys.
*  Toys the claim to give a developmental edge.
*  Toys you are pressured to buy.
*  Toys that inspire corrosive play.
*  Toy multiples.

Organize remaining toys: storage + relevant now ones.

Children's play flourishes when we "let it" rather than "make it" happen.

Relevant aspect are:

*  Trial and error.
*  Touch. Natural materials. Food preparation example.
*  Pretending: imaginary play. 
*  Experience. Children need experience not entertainment.
*  Purpose and industry. Children love to be busy and useful.
*  Nature. Helps to cope with the stress of modern life.
*  Social interaction.
*  Movement. Children need to move.
*  Art and music.

Books. Same principles are also applicable for books.

We honor the value of something (like reading) in our child's life by fostering a deep - not disposable - relationship to it.

Book-relevant point are:

*  Is it developmentally appropriate?
*  Is it based on a product or television character?
*  Does it tell an unfolding story or is it "all over the place"?

Clothes. It should also be simplified.

By simplifying clothes you easy transitions. You offer freedom from choice and overload, while still allowing for the slow and sure development of personal expression.

Scent / lighting -> amygdala triggering -> stress reaction.

Too much stimulation causes sensory overload. Adjust the tone and volume not only of sounds but also of smells and light in your home.

Recommendation for child's room are:

*  Unclutterd and restful to sense.
*  Soft light and colors, sense of order and space.
*  Room to move and play, draw and build.
*  Without toys that are broken, forgotten, or heaped in piles.
*  With a few of beloved toys in sight and the rest in 1 or 2 baskets on the floor, covered with cloth.
*  Handful of books, while others are stored ready.
*  Peaceful/secure place for sleep, with natural scents of home with minimal on no lighting.

Othe recommendations are:

* Child creates new ways of play, instead of requiring new toys.
* Spce in the clothes storage.
* Child's own tools and their happy sense of purpose when they work/play at cooking, cleaning, gardening.
* Child lives in now of they story or play, instead of always expecting what's next.
