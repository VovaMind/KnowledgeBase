# Simplicity parenting points

## intro

Too much: too much stuff, too many choices, too much information, too much speed.

Waldorf model was a basis here.

Recognizing overload.

It's never too late.

## why simplify

Simplication helps to protect the environment which allow for a child to slowly (which is essential) unfolding themselves.

Our society puts pressure of "too much" - it's problematic for child's development.

Pace of the daily life is usally and increasingly misaligned with the pace of childhood.

Protected childhood allows for the slow development of identity, well-being, and resiliency.

Families need inspiration, fresh infusions of hope, and imagination. Our daily life might disconnect us from this.

Simplification is a signal of change. It helps to realign our hopes and our everyday life.

Too much stuff leads to too little time and too little depth in the way kids see and explore their worlds.

Children are quirky :)

Stress can push children along the behaviorral spectrum. When you simplify a child's life on many levels, it helps.

The central struggle for parents: let our hopes for kids outweight our fears.

Behavioral tendencies can be soothed or relawxed by crearing calm.

Recommendations for home are:

*  Time moves a bit slower.
*  Everything is less cluttered and more visually relaxing.
*  Space and time for childhood, time for one another.
*  Play and exploration are allowed and appreciated.
*  Having more ease. Limit distractions. Say no to too much, too fast, too soon.
*  Sense of calm and security.
*  Atmospehere of attention, protection, and appreciation.
