# Simplicity parenting points

## intro

Too much: too much stuff, too many choices, too much information, too much speed.

Waldorf model was a basis here.

Recognizing overload.

It's never too late.

## why simplify

Simplication helps to protect the environment which allow for a child to slowly (which is essential) unfolding themselves.

Our society puts pressure of "too much" - it's problematic for child's development.

Pace of the daily life is usally and increasingly misaligned with the pace of childhood.

Protected childhood allows for the slow development of identity, well-being, and resiliency.

Families need inspiration, fresh infusions of hope, and imagination. Our daily life might disconnect us from this.

Simplification is a signal of change. It helps to realign our hopes and our everyday life.

Too much stuff leads to too little time and too little depth in the way kids see and explore their worlds.

Children are quirky :)

Stress can push children along the behaviorral spectrum. When you simplify a child's life on many levels, it helps.

The central struggle for parents: let our hopes for kids outweight our fears.

Behavioral tendencies can be soothed or relawxed by crearing calm.

Recommendations for home are:

*  Time moves a bit slower.
*  Everything is less cluttered and more visually relaxing.
*  Space and time for childhood, time for one another.
*  Play and exploration are allowed and appreciated.
*  Having more ease. Limit distractions. Say no to too much, too fast, too soon.
*  Sense of calm and security.
*  Atmospehere of attention, protection, and appreciation.

## soul fever

Comparison between pshysical fever and soul fever.

How to help: simplifications.

Noticing. 1st step. Ignoring symptoms could make it worse.

Quieting things down. Quiet weekend (maybe 3 days) is a good start / might be enough.

Bringing them close. Children need care. Quiet assurance and our presence/availability are important. The safest/most peaceful place: home or other.

There are many factors which could cause it.

Running its course. Such issues have their own duration. It's normal/natural, give it time.

A slow, strong return. You would notice their improvements after it. Carving time for children - emphasis on connection.

Recommendations are:

*  You would notice and respond, when something isn't right.
*  Suspend normal routines, when children are overwhelmed (physically or emotionally).
*  Take care for them: bring close, watch etc in case of well-being issues.
*  kinds can afford time to get better/recover.
*  You would love and look beyond their less-than-best selves.

## Evironemnt

Media pressure/influence on both kids and parents.

Too much stuff leads to too many choices.

The number of toys your child sees, and has access to, should be dramatically reduced.

As you decrease the quanity of your child's toys and clutter, you increase their attention and their capacity for deep play.

An avalance of toys invites emotional disconnect and a sense of overwhelm.

If you give a child less and less complexity, they become more interested, and this cultivates true power of attention.

Discard pile rules are:

*  Broken toys.
*  Developmentally inappropriate toys.
*  Conpetually "fixed" toys.
*  Toys that "do too much" and break too easily.
*  Very high-stimulation toys.
*  Annoying/offensive toys.
*  Toys the claim to give a developmental edge.
*  Toys you are pressured to buy.
*  Toys that inspire corrosive play.
*  Toy multiples.

Organize remaining toys: storage + relevant now ones.

Children's play flourishes when we "let it" rather than "make it" happen.

Relevant aspect are:

*  Trial and error.
*  Touch. Natural materials. Food preparation example.
*  Pretending: imaginary play. 
*  Experience. Children need experience not entertainment.
*  Purpose and industry. Children love to be busy and useful.
*  Nature. Helps to cope with the stress of modern life.
*  Social interaction.
*  Movement. Children need to move.
*  Art and music.

Books. Same principles are also applicable for books.

We honor the value of something (like reading) in our child's life by fostering a deep - not disposable - relationship to it.

Book-relevant point are:

*  Is it developmentally appropriate?
*  Is it based on a product or television character?
*  Does it tell an unfolding story or is it "all over the place"?

Clothes. It should also be simplified.

By simplifying clothes you easy transitions. You offer freedom from choice and overload, while still allowing for the slow and sure development of personal expression.

Scent / lighting -> amygdala triggering -> stress reaction.

Too much stimulation causes sensory overload. Adjust the tone and volume not only of sounds but also of smells and light in your home.

Recommendation for child's room are:

*  Unclutterd and restful to sense.
*  Soft light and colors, sense of order and space.
*  Room to move and play, draw and build.
*  Without toys that are broken, forgotten, or heaped in piles.
*  With a few of beloved toys in sight and the rest in 1 or 2 baskets on the floor, covered with cloth.
*  Handful of books, while others are stored ready.
*  Peaceful/secure place for sleep, with natural scents of home with minimal on no lighting.

Othe recommendations are:

* Child creates new ways of play, instead of requiring new toys.
* Spce in the clothes storage.
* Child's own tools and their happy sense of purpose when they work/play at cooking, cleaning, gardening.
* Child lives in now of they story or play, instead of always expecting what's next.


## Rhythm

Increasing the rhythm of your home life is one of the most powerful ways to simplifying your children's life.

Rhythm and ritual are what we aim for; predictability may be what we can achieve.

With predictability a child knows what to expect.

Rhythms establish a foundation of cooperation and connection.

Any repeated "note" of activity of the day can be made more rhythmic.

Rhythm builds islands of consistency and security throughout the day.

The rhythms of family life provide consistency; the best ones also offer connection.

Relationship are often built in the intervals, the spaces between activities, when noting much is going on.

Committing to rhythm builds trust and relational credits: a connection that is "bankable".

Family dinner as an anchor point.

The magic of rhythms is in the process, no the particulars.

Food is meant to nourish, not entertain or excite.

As parents simplify, their kids' food issues diminish or resolve quite naturally.

Consistency reinforces values that are larger than personal preferences.

Two/three pressure valves built into the day will help a child fall asleep at bedtime.

Bedtime stories as an example of rhythm.

Recommendations are:

*  Family's days have a sense of order, rhythm, and flow.
*  Difficult transitions being smoothed by reliable patterns.
*  Sense of consistency in the home. Joy of anticipation. Security of things that can be counted on daily.
*  Opportunities for connection. Moments of pause increasing as rhythms take hold.
*  Mental security fo the child, since they know how their day will proceed.
*  Child has a place in the task/rhythms of daily life. Their role is growing over time towards idependece.
*  Family dinners becoming more regular, food is familiar and comforting, the connections are evolving with repetition.
*  Fortune of stories which you are share.
*  Sense of family's identity from the number of together activities.

## Schedules

Free time for kids decreased over the last decades.

Too many scheduled activities may limit a child's ability to motivate and direct themselves.

Activity without downtime is ultimately - like a plant without roots - unsustainable.

Boredom ia often a good thing.

Balance activity and calming is important.

Bringing more awareness and balance to a child's schedule can better serve his or her needs.

Sabbath moments is a helpful concept.

Anticipation is important: it plays a role in identity building. Anticipation requires pauses.

Ordinary days are good. To fully appreciate "the ordinary" is an extraordinary gift.

Sports. Phsycological health vs sport results. Long term hobby vs a thing which I hate.

The messiness of free play, with its many changes and possibilities, builds an inner flexibility.

A child's love of an activity is not enough to protect them from the effects of pursuing it too much, and too soon.

Recommendations are:

*  Child has time every day - unscheduled free time - to daydream and play.
*  Benefits of occasional boredom gift.
*  Time to dream: developmental benefits.
*  Consciously balance crazier days with calmer days.
*  Pleasure of ordinary.
*  Benefits of unregulated, improvised, flexible free play.
*  Benefits of general physical activity for organized sport.
*  Genuine interests tage their time - more likely to become lifelong pleasures.
*  Importance of downtime and balance in daily life.

## Filtering out the adult world

Worry is an aspect of parenthood, but it shouldn't define it.

It's possible to say "No thanks", to minimize the effects of screens in our homes, at least while our children are young.

Symptopms of chronic stress: large mood swings, irritability, depressed or excessive tantrums, low frustration tolerance, poor self-regulation, oppostional-defiant behaviors etc.

By the time the average person reaches age seventy, he or she will have spent the equivalant of seven to ten years watching TV.

Overwhelming video games for yound children.

"Media saturation" characterizes our era, but it need not flood our kids' childhoods.

Four circles of connection:

1.  Connection to nature and the outdoors.
2.  Connection to friends and play.
3.  Connection to family and home.
4.  Connection to oneself.

Connection takes time.

"Base camp" - safe place for children.

Helicopter paranting - wrong strategy.

Children feed off their parents' emotions.

Technology has helped to blue the lines between privacy and independence, involved and "overinvolved".

Corporate parenting is another antipattern, e.g. launches, desired results etc.

Peer parenting is an antipattern.

Clown parent is an antipattern.

Filtering adult conversation - important.

The more you say, the less you are listening.

Adult topics - filter it.

Increasing the rhythm of your home life is one of the most powerful ways of simplifying your children's lives.

Children need to know that they have a place in a good world, full of promise.

Key filters before you are saying something:

1.  Is it true?
2.  Is it kind?
3.  Is it necessary?
4.  Will it help the child feel secure?

Backing off - work together. A partnership that is balanced in terms of parenting yields benefits for all: a strengthened partnership and much less hovering.

Less emotional monitoring. Don't talk too much to children aged nine or younger about their feelings. This is confusing / distressing for kids.

The heart of being a parent - the joy of it - it still unpredictable. Absolutely remarkable and unexpected.

Explaining tragedies / bad events. Keep it simple, focus on positive, provide hope.

Recommendations are:

*  Feeling calmer, safes, less anxious as a parent.
*  Maintaining your emotional well-being as a goal, and taking steps to reduce your exposure to media that profit from fear and sensationalism.
*  Your child's early years, without television.
*  How engagements and connection - rather than passive "entertainment" - will feed your child's imagination, and enrich their play.
*  Your child not being exposed to TV while they're young.
*  You child isn't involved in adult issues/problems.
*  Sense of calm increasing in your home.
*  Empasizing connection + increasing the regularity of daily life while your child is young, your are building a base camp of security that will serve them into adulthood.
*  Increase your chances of being heard when you talk less.
*  Being less overinvolved - more inolved  in daily tasks of parenting,
*  Kind, true, more necessary communicaiton.
*  Rich appreciation of the present.

## Value-centered family leadership

Wrong messages from media: wrong values, e.g. disrespect for parents/adults.

Premature socila midea - dangerous.

Avoid horizontal attachements to your kids.

We are safe harbor from which our children launch out into the world and return to safety, repair, and resupply, ready to launch again.

Peer parenting - wrong.

It is at the itersection when a child's wishes meet our adult direction and guidance that the all-important formation of a child's character takes place.

An authoritarian adult is cold, detached, and inflexible. An authoritative parent is warm, clear, and connected.

It is vales that need to be at center of our family, not children.

Don't forget about self-care.

Family design is crucial.

Friends vs friendly.

Recommendation are:

*  A home where your dearly held values are at the center of family life each day.
*  A place where you shape the decisions about what is helpful and healthy for kids with pressure from media.
*  You children knowing deep inside themselves that you are a safe harbor.
*  Children hearing loving, authoritative firmness in your voice and better accepting your directions.
*  Feeling more ease and energy within you as you go through the day with your child.
*  Being able to fully enjoy visits with friends and family knowing you can step in and redirect your child if needed, with quiet confidence.
*  Your child being able to follow teacher's instruction, love learning, make good friends, and thrive at school.
*  The security your children will feel as they experience their two parents' consistency of approach.
