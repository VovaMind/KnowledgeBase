# Deep work

## Introduction

**Deep work**: professional activities perfomed in a state of distraction-free concentraition that push your congitive abilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Many examples of well-known / successful folks.

**Shallow work**: noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.

The growing necessity of deep work.

Deep work is rare and valuable in the modern economy.

## Deep work is valuable

Examples: journalists, writers, business folks.

3 groups with good future:

*  High-skilled workers. The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not? They work well and creatively.
*  The superstars. Music / movie stars etc. Winner takes it all concept.
*  The owners. Good investments / existing capital.

Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy:

*  The ability to quickly master hard things.
*  THe ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

The abilities above depen on your ability to perform deep work.

Deep work helps you quickly learn hard things.

Deep work helps you produce at an elite level.

High quality work produced = (time spent) x (intersity of focus)

The concepts of attention and attention residue.

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction: type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.

Counter-examples: CEOs (managers) that are always distracted. Deep work is only valuable skill, but places when it's the case are very rare.

## Deep work is rare

Modern trend: open spaces, it's bad for deep work.

IMs, emails, quick replies are a part of the business culture. Real time collaboration story.

Social media presence is anothe trend.

Metric: time spent on emails / messages etc. It was very high. It can be per worker or per company.

It's getting harder to measure indivudiual efforts to the collective success.

People just accept the culture of connectivity. Experiment: slower replies for a team, it turned out being positive there.

The principle of least resistance: no clear feedback on impact of behaviours -> tend toward behaviours that are easiest in the moment.

Regular meetings can be a waste - example. Emails forwarding is another example.

Busyness is used as a proxy for productivity. No clear indicators of impact -> worker (knowledge) turn toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

Internet and its usage are frequent, and they are a part of our attention.

## Deep work is meaningful

Examples of folks. The most complicated thing -> challenge that drives me.

Many disciplines suggest that the skillful management of attention is very important for good life, and the key to every aspect of your experience.

Emails often bring shallow concerns, and it produces unhappiness.

Deep work increases the meaning and satisfaction from your working life.

Phychlogical agrument: concept of **flow**, or precence. It makes the life better.

More free time might make stuff actually less enjoyable: folks need stuff to do.

Satisfaction from high quality work.

I will the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.

## Work deeply

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes deplepted as you use it.

Key to develop a deep work habit: add routines and rituals. Idea: minimize the amount of your limited willpower in order to transit to a state of unbroken concentration.

Different ways of integrating depth into schedule.

*  Monstic approach. Idea: eliminate / radically minimize shallow obligations.
*  Bimodal approach. Divide your time. You need to have clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits. Divide your working year or week examples.
*  Rhythmic approach. Idea is to build simple regular habbit. No need to invest energy into deciding. Signals: marks on calendar, specific time of day. No barries to entry for going deep.
*  Journalistic approach. Any time that you could find - focus on deep work. It's hard for novices. 
*  Ritualize. Find and use your ritual. 
    *  Where will you work and how long.
    *  How will you work once you start to work.
    *  How will you support your work. e.g. coffee / snack / light excercise.
*  Make grand gestures. Working from an expensive hotel example. Trip to work from another place.

Collaboration. It's an important aspect of work. But it's not a reason for open space: secluded areas are required. Random distractions kill depth. Combination of deep work/thinking and communication (e.g. whiteboarding) - way to produce better output.

Consider you work as business, execute it like business. It implies the following disciplines:

*  Focus on wildly important.
*  Act on the lead measures. The idea is to prepare stuff in advance. Dedicate time/efforts.
*  Keep a compelling scoreboard.
*  Create a cadence of accountability. Talk about scoreboards etc.

Be lazy sometimes. It's good. Your brain needs time to rest. The ideas:

*  Downtime aids insights.
*  Downtime helps recharge the energy beeded to work deeply.
*  The work that replaces downtime is usually not that important.

Deep work requires a commitment.

End of the day ritual (example):

*  Check pending tasks and figure out a plan there.
*  Check the calendar and upcoming meetings.
*  Idea: make sure that nothing urgent wasn't missed.
*  Plan the next day.
*  Ritual phrase, e.g. that's all for today.

Shutdown ritual is helpful to give your mind rest. Coming up with specific plans is helpful. It might make you uneasy, if you skip it, and the ritual is used for a long time.

## Embrace boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a an important skill.

It's hard to focus, if there is a distraction.

Multitasking is problematic, it's hard to filter out irrelevant stuff.

Bad habits for concentration. It might be hard to concentrate, even if you want to.

Improve your concentration limit. Two goals for training: improve your ability to concerntrate, overcoming your desire for distraction.

Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus. If hard to overcome, if you are wired for distraction.

Internet Sabbath/detox concepts. It's probably not the best way forward.

Schedule distraction (e.g. internet) windows in advance. And try to avoid it outside of these windows.

The idea is that focusing suffers from the constant switching at a slightest hint of boredom. This teaches your mid to never tolerate an absence of novelty. 
This is weaking the mental muscles that are responsible for you attention. It's hard to put this in practice.
Relevant points are:

1.  This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use / promt email replies.
2.  Regardless of how schedule distraction blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutly free from distraction (internet / social networks).
3.  Scheduling distraction (internet) at home as well as at work can further improve your concerntation training.

It's important to rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. Distacting activities shoudln't hijack your attention.

Schedule high intensity working days. Give yourself deadlines, maybe publicly commit to it. This will motivate you for greater intensity.

Productive meditation. Walking, joggig, driving, showering. Focus your attention on a single well-defined problem. It requires practice to master.
Some relevant suggestions are:

*  Be wary of distractions and looping. Repeating similar results multiple times - looping.
*  Structure your thiking. For writing - list of main points. Identify known stuff. Identify a specific next-step question that you need to answer. It's important to consolidate the results/gains/answers that were gained.

Memorization. Mental sportsmen. The trick is not memory itself, but concentration. Scene picturing trick.

## Quit social media 

Experiences of quitting social media: less stress etc.

Social media tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.

Sabbatical idea, it's probably suboptimal approach. Maybe we should introduce a threshold for it.

Benefits from social networks are often minor and somewhat random. It's rarely meaningful.

The any-benefit approach: justification is based on any possible benefit / anything might be useful there.
The problem with it: it ignores negative aspects.

There are multiple negative aspects: addictive, robbing time and attention, it brings you to burned-out / hyperdistracted connectivity state.

Farmer example / deep understaning of the domain. Something doesn't make sense economically / trade-offs consideration.

The craftsman approach to tool selection: 

*  Identify core factors that determine success and hapiness in your professional and personal life.
*  Adopt a tool only if its positive impact on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

Apply the law of the vital few to your internet habits. The key steps are:

1.  Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal life. Keep the descriptions on a fairly high level. You should have a small number of goals for both areas.
2.  Identify 2-3 most important activites that help you satisfy the goal. Activities should be specific enough for clear picture of doing it, but not onetime outcome.
3.  Consider network tools that you are using. Estimate a substantially positive/negative impacts.
4.  Decision: use, only if positive impact >> negative impact.

The law of the vital few: in many settings 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.

It's a zero-sum game: spending time on low priority things, you are robbing time from high priority things. Thus, you need to focus on high prioirity things.
This is relevant for business, professional/personal goals.

Idea of throwing away the stuff that you aren't actually using.

Try to quit temporary and check whether you are missing anything.

Don't use the internet to entertain yourself. 

There is a lot of time outside of your working hours. Fight for depth, don't allow robbing your attention.

Put more thought into your leisure time. Figure out in advance what you are going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.

Give your brain a quality alternative for your free time. It will preserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate.

## Drain the shallows

Workweek shortening experiment: it was positive.

Working hours vs productive hours.

Month hold for business experiment: also worked positive.

Deep work is exhausting, since it pushes you towards your limit. The human capacity is between 1h and 4h per day. You shouldn't push your after your limit: negative impact on you and work.

Shallow activities might take a lot of time, so there is not much time for deep work.

Schedule every minute of your day:

*  We spend much of our day on autopilot.
*  What makes the most sense right now?
*  Use lined paper in notebook. Split your day into blocks.
*  Things will go wrong with the schedule. It's ok.
*  If the schedule disrupted, then take time and revise it. Maybe you will do it multiple times.
*  Not just sticking to it, but being thoughtful about future plans.
*  You will underestimate required time. Best-case scenario thinking or wishful thinking - make an effort for accurate predictions.
*  Overflow conditional blocks.
*  Be libreal for task blocks. Schedule many blocks, keep them longer than needed.
*  Concern: schedule might bring too much stress. Encourage spontaneity in the schedule. It won't be stressful, if you flexible/positive about it.
*  Deep work requires treating your time with respect.
*  Natural push back at first.

Quantify the depth of every activity:

*  Shallow work vs deep work.
*  Criteria: how long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no spezialized training in my field to complete this task?

Ask your boss for a shalow work budget.

Finish your early (by 17:30 or so). Fixed-schedue productivity. It helps to drain shallows / push back on shallow activities.

Become hard to reach. Some tips are:

*  Make people who send you e-mail do more work.
*  Do more work when you send or reply to e-mail. What is the most effective (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conlcusions? Process-centric response. It might be hard at first / it will require more efforts for a single reply, but it optimizes stuff globally: less replies/distractions are required.
*  Don't respond.

## Conclusion

Obsessive focus concept.

Different levels of deep work adoption.
