# Deep work

## Introduction

**Deep work**: professional activities perfomed in a state of distraction-free concentraition that push your congitive abilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Many examples of well-known / successful folks.

**Shallow work**: noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.

The growing necessity of deep work.

Deep work is rare and valuable in the modern economy.

## Deep work is valuable

Examples: journalists, writers, business folks.

3 groups with good future:

*  High-skilled workers. The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not? They work well and creatively.
*  The superstars. Music / movie stars etc. Winner takes it all concept.
*  The owners. Good investments / existing capital.

Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy:

*  The ability to quickly master hard things.
*  THe ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

The abilities above depen on your ability to perform deep work.

Deep work helps you quickly learn hard things.

Deep work helps you produce at an elite level.

High quality work produced = (time spent) x (intersity of focus)

The concepts of attention and attention residue.

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction: type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.

Counter-examples: CEOs (managers) that are always distracted. Deep work is only valuable skill, but places when it's the case are very rare.

## Deep work is rare

Modern trend: open spaces, it's bad for deep work.

IMs, emails, quick replies are a part of the business culture. Real time collaboration story.

Social media presence is anothe trend.

Metric: time spent on emails / messages etc. It was very high. It can be per worker or per company.

It's getting harder to measure indivudiual efforts to the collective success.

People just accept the culture of connectivity. Experiment: slower replies for a team, it turned out being positive there.

The principle of least resistance: no clear feedback on impact of behaviours -> tend toward behaviours that are easiest in the moment.

Regular meetings can be a waste - example. Emails forwarding is another example.

Busyness is used as a proxy for productivity. No clear indicators of impact -> worker (knowledge) turn toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

Internet and its usage are frequent, and they are a part of our attention.

## Deep work is meaningful

Examples of folks. The most complicated thing -> challenge that drives me.

Many disciplines suggest that the skillful management of attention is very important for good life, and the key to every aspect of your experience.

Emails often bring shallow concerns, and it produces unhappiness.

Deep work increases the meaning and satisfaction from your working life.

Phychlogical agrument: concept of **flow**, or precence. It makes the life better.

More free time might make stuff actually less enjoyable: folks need stuff to do.

Satisfaction from high quality work.

I will the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.
