## Managing human resource

*  High-tech illusion: we tend to overfocus on techologies, we should focus on people instead.
*  Software != making a cheeseburger. We need to allow making errors (quota for errors), don't try to push people: they normally love their work, it's good when people are unique, different roles are important (e.g. catalyst role), make time for thinking / study new stuff (both you and team).
*  Don't stick to tight schedule extra-working hours (overtime). Overtime can bring only short-term benefits. Does the schedule really have its value?
*  Quality vs time restrictions. Less quality/excellence - eng folks are less happy. Management perspective is different - time is more important than quality. Ideal approach: veto on too strict deadlines.
*  Parkinson's law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. It's was a kind of joke intially. Many folks consider it seriously. Estimations aren't helpful for productivity, especially top-down ones. Estimations from third parties (system analysists etc) tend to work better than company ones, but it's still better without estimations. 
*  We have tendency to seek simple non-working solutions for hard problems. In reality, the solutions tend to be complicated/unpleasant. Hot/new tricks/technologies aren't' the answer normally. Manager's function isn't to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

## Office environment

*  Office environment tend to be noisy/non-productive. As a results, people can do their best work only too late/early/at home. Coding war experiment: programming tasks for measuring productivity, it's a competitions, it helps to estimate different things (e.g. environment in this context). 
*  Useful rules of thumb for statistics: best people outpeform worst by 10:1, best performers outperform median ones by 2.5:1, better than median half to worse than median half is 2+:1.
*  Productivity non-factors: programming language, years of experience, number of defects (?), salary.
*  Workplace environment plays a key role in productivity.
*  Organizatios tend to save money on space. It's a fairly new IT trend. It's frustrating, people tend to hide out. Issue: hard to measure productivity, easy to measure workplace costs money -> management tends to pick a wrong approach.
*  Brain time != body time. Flow is important, but it's hard to achieve / easy to break. Endless no-flow is frustrating. Time accouting based on flow, working time - interruptions time (~15? min to reach the flow after the interruption). E-factor = uninterrupted hours / body-present hours.
