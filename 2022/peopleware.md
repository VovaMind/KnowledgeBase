## Managing human resource

*  High-tech illusion: we tend to overfocus on techologies, we should focus on people instead.
*  Software != making a cheeseburger. We need to allow making errors (quota for errors), don't try to push people: they normally love their work, it's good when people are unique, different roles are important (e.g. catalyst role), make time for thinking / study new stuff (both you and team).
*  Don't stick to tight schedule extra-working hours (overtime). Overtime can bring only short-term benefits. Does the schedule really have its value?
*  Quality vs time restrictions. Less quality/excellence - eng folks are less happy. Management perspective is different - time is more important than quality. Ideal approach: veto on too strict deadlines.
*  Parkinson's law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. It's was a kind of joke intially. Many folks consider it seriously. Estimations aren't helpful for productivity, especially top-down ones. Estimations from third parties (system analysists etc) tend to work better than company ones, but it's still better without estimations. 
*  We have tendency to seek simple non-working solutions for hard problems. In reality, the solutions tend to be complicated/unpleasant. Hot/new tricks/technologies aren't' the answer normally. Manager's function isn't to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.
*  Work split is three big chunks: alone, 1:1, more people. More people is ~20-30% -> optimize for working alone / in pairs.

## Office environment

*  Office environment tend to be noisy/non-productive. As a results, people can do their best work only too late/early/at home. Coding war experiment: programming tasks for measuring productivity, it's a competitions, it helps to estimate different things (e.g. environment in this context). 
*  Useful rules of thumb for statistics: best people outpeform worst by 10:1, best performers outperform median ones by 2.5:1, better than median half to worse than median half is 2+:1.
*  Productivity non-factors: programming language, years of experience, number of defects (?), salary.
*  Workplace environment plays a key role in productivity.
*  Organizatios tend to save money on space. It's a fairly new IT trend. It's frustrating, people tend to hide out. Issue: hard to measure productivity, easy to measure workplace costs money -> management tends to pick a wrong approach.
*  Brain time != body time. Flow is important, but it's hard to achieve / easy to break. Endless no-flow is frustrating. Time accouting based on flow, working time - interruptions time (~15? min to reach the flow after the interruption). E-factor = uninterrupted hours / body-present hours.  
*  Telephone can be bad: direct and iterrupting flow + potentially distracting for others. Can it be replaced by email?
*  Appearance isn't that important. Noise cancellation + doors might be vital. Creative spaces can be combined with isolated spaces.
*  Ideal can be described in many patterns/details/options. Take smal steps to improve the corporate space.

## Right people

*  Cultivate uniqueness and non-unifromity. Dress code is bad :) Professional (dress code etc) is a popular anti-pattern. Focus on your team, not the whole company.
*  Leadership is a service. Cultivate innovation: free time to study, change accommodation. Use humor/goodwill, maximize valur to everyone, step up for tasks, do homework in advance.
*  Team jell concerpt - well-formed team.
*  Ask for samples of their work. The portfolio can be useful. Aptitude tests are usually bad, since they don't cover many improtant aspects. Audition approach: ask them to present + estimate it together with the team. The topic should be work-related.
*  Mixed team is a good idea. Women play a huge role in the industry. All-male teams are less effective. Absorbing newness has its limits.
*  Generational differences are there. Partial attention is a modern issue. Partial attention might be problematic for meetings/flow at work. Emails/interruptions might be very problematic for productivity.
*  Turnover story: what is the annual turnover in the organization + what is the cost of replacement. There are obvious costs: time with less people + hiring cost etc. Hidden cost: time for a peson to become productive + becoming productive will require costs from the other team members. High turnover brings multiple issues: no long-term involvement, feeling of disposability, being loyal seems stupid in this context. Mentality of permanence.  Best organizations strive to be the best, and they have low turnover. Widespread retraing is improtant for low tunrover. It's imortant in the long term, and not only cost effective.
*  Expense != investment. Expense - paid for heat, investment - bought new computers. Expense - money lost, invenstment - money transfer. For people it can be both, but it's rather investment. Productivity loss due to changing a person: time to become productive + time from others to help. Ramp-up time is ~months. It's very conventional to consider money spent on people as expenses.
