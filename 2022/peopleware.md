## Managing human resource

*  High-tech illusion: we tend to overfocus on techologies, we should focus on people instead.
*  Software != making a cheeseburger. We need to allow making errors (quota for errors), don't try to push people: they normally love their work, it's good when people are unique, different roles are important (e.g. catalyst role), make time for thinking / study new stuff (both you and team).
*  Don't stick to tight schedule extra-working hours (overtime). Overtime can bring only short-term benefits. Does the schedule really have its value?
