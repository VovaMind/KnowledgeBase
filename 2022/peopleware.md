## Managing human resource

*  High-tech illusion: we tend to overfocus on techologies, we should focus on people instead.
*  Software != making a cheeseburger. We need to allow making errors (quota for errors), don't try to push people: they normally love their work, it's good when people are unique, different roles are important (e.g. catalyst role), make time for thinking / study new stuff (both you and team).
*  Don't stick to tight schedule extra-working hours (overtime). Overtime can bring only short-term benefits. Does the schedule really have its value?
*  Quality vs time restrictions. Less quality/excellence - eng folks are less happy. Management perspective is different - time is more important than quality. Ideal approach: veto on too strict deadlines.
*  Parkinson's law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. It's was a kind of joke intially. Many folks consider it seriously. Estimations aren't helpful for productivity, especially top-down ones. Estimations from third parties (system analysists etc) tend to work better than company ones, but it's still better without estimations. 
*  We have tendency to seek simple non-working solutions for hard problems. In reality, the solutions tend to be complicated/unpleasant. Hot/new tricks/technologies aren't' the answer normally. Manager's function isn't to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.
