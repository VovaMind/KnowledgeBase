## Managing human resource

*  High-tech illusion: we tend to overfocus on techologies, we should focus on people instead.
*  Software != making a cheeseburger. We need to allow making errors (quota for errors), don't try to push people: they normally love their work, it's good when people are unique, different roles are important (e.g. catalyst role), make time for thinking / study new stuff (both you and team).
*  Don't stick to tight schedule extra-working hours (overtime). Overtime can bring only short-term benefits. Does the schedule really have its value?
*  Quality vs time restrictions. Less quality/excellence - eng folks are less happy. Management perspective is different - time is more important than quality. Ideal approach: veto on too strict deadlines.
*  Parkinson's law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. It's was a kind of joke intially. Many folks consider it seriously. Estimations aren't helpful for productivity, especially top-down ones. Estimations from third parties (system analysists etc) tend to work better than company ones, but it's still better without estimations. 
*  We have tendency to seek simple non-working solutions for hard problems. In reality, the solutions tend to be complicated/unpleasant. Hot/new tricks/technologies aren't' the answer normally. Manager's function isn't to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.
*  Work split is three big chunks: alone, 1:1, more people. More people is ~20-30% -> optimize for working alone / in pairs.

## Office environment

*  Office environment tend to be noisy/non-productive. As a results, people can do their best work only too late/early/at home. Coding war experiment: programming tasks for measuring productivity, it's a competitions, it helps to estimate different things (e.g. environment in this context). 
*  Useful rules of thumb for statistics: best people outpeform worst by 10:1, best performers outperform median ones by 2.5:1, better than median half to worse than median half is 2+:1.
*  Productivity non-factors: programming language, years of experience, number of defects (?), salary.
*  Workplace environment plays a key role in productivity.
*  Organizatios tend to save money on space. It's a fairly new IT trend. It's frustrating, people tend to hide out. Issue: hard to measure productivity, easy to measure workplace costs money -> management tends to pick a wrong approach.
*  Brain time != body time. Flow is important, but it's hard to achieve / easy to break. Endless no-flow is frustrating. Time accouting based on flow, working time - interruptions time (~15? min to reach the flow after the interruption). E-factor = uninterrupted hours / body-present hours.  
*  Telephone can be bad: direct and iterrupting flow + potentially distracting for others. Can it be replaced by email?
*  Appearance isn't that important. Noise cancellation + doors might be vital. Creative spaces can be combined with isolated spaces.
*  Ideal can be described in many patterns/details/options. Take smal steps to improve the corporate space.

## Right people

*  Cultivate uniqueness and non-unifromity. Dress code is bad :) Professional (dress code etc) is a popular anti-pattern. Focus on your team, not the whole company.
*  Leadership is a service. Cultivate innovation: free time to study, change accommodation. Use humor/goodwill, maximize valur to everyone, step up for tasks, do homework in advance.
*  Team jell concerpt - well-formed team.
*  Ask for samples of their work. The portfolio can be useful. Aptitude tests are usually bad, since they don't cover many improtant aspects. Audition approach: ask them to present + estimate it together with the team. The topic should be work-related.
*  Mixed team is a good idea. Women play a huge role in the industry. All-male teams are less effective. Absorbing newness has its limits.
*  Generational differences are there. Partial attention is a modern issue. Partial attention might be problematic for meetings/flow at work. Emails/interruptions might be very problematic for productivity.
*  Turnover story: what is the annual turnover in the organization + what is the cost of replacement. There are obvious costs: time with less people + hiring cost etc. Hidden cost: time for a peson to become productive + becoming productive will require costs from the other team members. High turnover brings multiple issues: no long-term involvement, feeling of disposability, being loyal seems stupid in this context. Mentality of permanence.  Best organizations strive to be the best, and they have low turnover. Widespread retraing is improtant for low tunrover. It's imortant in the long term, and not only cost effective.
*  Expense != investment. Expense - paid for heat, investment - bought new computers. Expense - money lost, invenstment - money transfer. For people it can be both, but it's rather investment. Productivity loss due to changing a person: time to become productive + time from others to help. Ramp-up time is ~months. It's very conventional to consider money spent on people as expenses.

## Growing productive teams

*  Jell in teams. Team != group. Jelled team: its production > sum of its part. They are happy to work together. They got momentum. Teams are formed around goals. Goal might be arbitrary, but team must accept it. It's not hard to foster (manager?) such a team. We need to align goals, not attain goals. Key signs are: low turnover, sense of identity, sense of eliteness, feeling of joint ownership of the product. Team != clique, but semantics might seem similar. It might look self-sufficient, irritating, exclusive.
*  Teamicide concept: how not to get a jelled team. Hard to suggest ideas for doing it, but there are ways to prevent it. Antipatterns aka temicide strategy. Anipatterns are: defensive management, bureaucracy, physical separation, fragmentation of people's time, quality reduction of the product, phony deadlines, clique control. Most organizations don't set out consciously to kill teams, they just act that way.
*  More antipatterns: motivational accessories, overtime.
*  Competition within a team. There are different opinions about it, it can be for sure negative. Family example: siblings that don't compete with each other will have better relationships in the future; the same principal is also somewhat relevant to teams. e.g. coaching can be problematic in the competitive environment. More temicide items are: annual salary/merits review, management by objectivities, praise centrain workers for their accomplishments, awards tied to performance, performance measurement.  It leads to fostering competition -> hostile environment. Musical ensemble is a good methaphor.
*  Spahetti dinner example: simple teamwork to become closer. Quick group success. As a good manager you need to provide frequent easy oppirtunities for the team to succeed together. Examples are: tiny pilots, demos, simulations. Habit of succeeding together. The best boss is the one who can manage this over and oevr without the team members knowing that they're managed.
*  It's hard to gurantee team's gell, but some folks are better at it than others. Open kimono attitude != defensive management. You should trust folks with their autonomy, otherwise they aren't really useful for you. Example: sign prepared contract without reading them, i.e. you trust your counsel. Classical example of defensive management is physical oversight. Don't cause problems for your folks. Occaisonal insubordination is ok. Different projects are interested for different people, let them chose, and even not shiny projects will be picked. Take chances on people. Strive to natural authority.
*  Chemistry factor. Strategies for chemistry-building for a healthy organization: make a cult of quality, provide a lot of satisfying closure, build a sense of eliteness, allow and encourage heterogeneity, preserve and protect successful teams, provide strategic but not tactical directions. You can't always make a jelled team, but it's worth trying.

### Fertile soil

*  System should be able to help itself. Fully automated system can't heal itself. Don't be too mad about the methodology. Declare standard, only if it's already there. Revisting the high-tech illusion: no magic methodology can actually help.
*  Risks: can be justified or stupid. Main problem is likely sociological, not technological. We shouldn't run away from risks. It's very hard to manage the risk of our own failure. Risk management: it won't make risks to go away, but it will enable sensible mitigation. It might be fine not manager a risk that has a low probability. It's not reasonable not to manage a risk with huge consequences. Manageres have tendency to create challenges without good reason, and want to finish a project cheaply. Aggressive delivery date is a false challenge.
*  Meetings addiction, meetings instead of actual work :) Meetings should be specific and time bounded. Laptop usage at the meeting is bad sign. Working meeting should always have a specific end condition, i.e. you know when they're done / a decision was reached. Specify what group action would terminate a meeting. Ceremony meetings - mostly time wasting. Reduce the number of participants. Open space meetings can serve as a distraction. What ends this meeting test.
*  The ultimate management sin is wasting people's time. Example: multiple people are waiting for your arrival.  Status meetings might not bring much value. Early overstuffing is wrong. Productivity is low at the strart, and it gets accelerated over time. Fragmentation is still a concern. 
*  Emails can be harmful. For example: corporate spam, FYI emails, org != commune i.e. people don't need to know everything. Passive consent != consent. Build spam-less self-coordination org.
*  People hate changes. Chunks of people that react on changes: blindly loyal (ask no questions), believers but questions (skeptics, passive observers, opposed because of fear of change, opposed because of fear of loss of power), militantly opposed (will undermine and destroy).  Rely on / start with skeptics. In the other words, the majority will resist at the start. Model is trick, it's no old bad->new good, it's old status->chaos->practice and integration->new status quo. People must feel safe to make the change possible.
*  Learning is critical in orgs. Learning is limited by an ability to keep its people. It's important to find time for learning. 
*  Building a community is important. It won't happen on the job, it had to be made. Good community -> better people keeping/retention.
